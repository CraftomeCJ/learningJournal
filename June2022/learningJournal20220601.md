# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 22:
Make an important or Difficult Decision:
  The creative intelligence of my subconscious mind knows what is best for me.
  Its tendency is always life-ward, and it reveals to me the right decision, which blessed all concerned.
  I give thanks for the answer which I know will come to me.
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Least Effort: **"Is that so?" Apply the Power of Non-Resistance**<br/>
Shows the good through inner non-resistance. <br/>
Accept people, situations and events as they occur. Take responsibility for my situation and for all events seen as problems. <br/>
Relinquish the need to defend my point of view. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Least Effort into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. I will practice Acceptance. Today I will accept people, situations and events as they occur. I will know that this moment is as it should be, because the whole universe is as it should be. I will not struggle against the whole universe by struggling against this moment. My acceptance is total and complete. I accept things as they are this moment, not as I wish they were.
  2. Having accepted things as they are, I will take Responsibility for my situation and for all those events I see as problems. I know that taking responsibility means not blaming anyone or anything for my situation (and this includes myself). I also know that every problem is an opportunity in disguise, and this alertness to opportunities allows me to take this moment and transform it into a greater benefit.
  3. Today my awareness will remain established in Defenselessness. I will give up the need to defend my point of view. I will feel no need to convince or persuade others to accept my point of view. I will remain open to all view and not be rigidly attached to any one of them.-->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
<!-- JUNE
The Divine Craft
Mastering The Arts Of Indirection And Manipulation:
The month of June will teach me how to make people bend to my will without their realizing what I have done. And if they do not realize what I have done, they will neither resent nor resist me. -->
Wear the Appropriate Mask<br/>
Playing with appearances and mastering arts of deception are among the aesthetics pleasures of life. <br/>They are also key components ih the acquisition of power. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man always said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Never give up hope. All things are working for your good. One day, you'll look back on everything you've been through and thank God for it." - Germany Kent <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm grateful for:** the stress I feel, for it pushes me to get the job done. <br/>

<!-- what has holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Core Traits of a **"SOCIALLY INTELLIGENT PERSON"**: <br/>
They don't "poison the well" or fall for ad hominem fallacy to disprove a point. <br/>
"Poisoning the well" is when someone attacks the character of a person so as to shift the attention away from the (possibly very valid) point being made. <br/>For example, if a person who eat 3 candy bars a day says: "I don't think it's healthy for children to eat too much candy each day," a socially intelligent person wouldn't respond, "Who are you to say that?"; they would be able to see the statement objective from the person who is saying it. <br/> Usually, it is people who are most inflicted with an issue that are able to speak out on the importance of it (even if it seems hypocritical on the surface).

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When would this work?
- Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [x] Would I buy this new trinket with two or three hours of my time, instead of paying with a $50 note? What if it's actually the same thing as losing 15 hours of my life over the long run? Is it still worth it? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

<!-- Coding as a Career -->
<!-- learn remind myself how much I have to learn -->
<!-- learn stop trying to prove myself right
  - ask myself how I can make this better?
  - actively look for where I am wrong? -->
<!-- learn "the code works" isn't where I stop; it's where I start!!
  - step 1 ==> always write quality code that fulfils the spec
  - step 2 ==> Now, make it better!!
    1. Is it valuable to make it faster?
    2. easier to document?
    3. more reusable?
    4. more reliable? -->
<!-- learn write it THREE times
  - First time ==> write the software to prove myself that the solution is possible;
  - Second time ==> make it work
  - Third time ==> make it work right
  - throw away code and start over will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub. -->
<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

<!-- Strategies that help me to push through beginner phase:
  - I will continue to make programs from scratch
    - start writing my own code, without instruction
    - start with an empty file, and type every line of code myself
    - look at other people's code
    - Analyse other people's code
    - learn a little bit about how it works, then write it myself
  - I will start small, very small
    - make something that would be useful in real life
    - start with load of make text-based games, time tracker, to-do list, or something to automate calculations
    - use these projects to learn all of the features of JavaScript, React, and TypeScript
  - write lots of code
    - I have to make software to gain skill
    - The program I make will not do much, and it will probably have messy code, but that doesn't matter
    - read some theory, get some advice, and make a new program
    - each program I make should be bigger and better than the last
    - Repeat these steps for long enough, and I will become an expert
  - ask for help
    - it's OK to ask for help only if I do these:
      - always try to google my problem first
      - analyse the answer and learn the cause behind my error
      - this way, when I encounter the same error again, I will already know how to fix it
    - If I constantly hitting unsolvable problems, that probably means that my project is too ambitious
    - Scale it back, and make something smaller until my skills improve
  - asking help the right way
    - **paste in my exact error message**
      - this is the most important piece of information
    - if there is no error message, **explain what I expected to happen, and what actually happened**
      - something like "I expect it to output 5, but it actually outputs 7"
      - Often, the problem isn't in my code, it's in my expectations
      - If I don't explain what I expected, I will get answers like "the code looks fine" and "what is the problem?"
    - **paste in my broken code**
      - It's very difficult to debug a problem without seeing the code
      - paste it all in, if it's not too big, because people will run my code to investigate the problem
      - If there is too much code, paste it into a Github Gist or Pastebin.com, then put the link into my question
    - **format my code correctly**
      - don't just paste in my code like normal text
      - learn how to format my code nicely so it is easy to read

```python
# It should look like this:

def foobar
  puts 1 + 2 / 3
end
```

```python
# Not like this:

def foobar
puts 1+2/3
end
```

- **mention what I have already tried**
  - this tells people that I've already put in some effort.

- **try to use correct terminology**
  - make an effort to learn the common terms, and use them correctly.

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to my Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->

2. TBC

## Personal Notes

**Day 59 (Wednesday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday will be building tracking app, breakdown SHARE Nx structure, define programming terminology, read on Unit Test. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
- **Fundamental**
  - [The five basic elements](https://study.com/academy/lesson/5-basic-elements-of-programming.html), in programming are:
    - **Input**: getting data and commands into the computer
    - **Output**: getting your results out of the computer
    - **Variables and data structures**: storing information, which may change over time
    - **Mathematical operations (arithmetic)**: Performing mathematical calculations on your data
    - **Looping and conditionals**: testing to see if a condition is true of false, and cycling through a set of instructions until some condition is met

  - [Computer Programming - Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_basics.htm)
  - [Programming Terminology](https://careerkarma.com/blog/programming-terminology/)

  - [Naming Conventions](https://unional.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/pages/default/draft/naming-conventions.html)
    - Single letter names
      - Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming.
    - Name casing
      - Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances. eslint: camelCase jscs: requireCamelCaseOrUpperCaseIdentifiers
      - Use PascalCase when naming constructors or classes. eslint: new-cap jscs: requireCapitalizedConstructors
      - Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function's name.
      - Use PascalCase when you export a singleton / function library / bare object.
    - Name prefixes
      - Use a leading underscore _ when naming private properties. eslint: no-underscore-dangle jscs: disallowDanglingUnderscores
    - this reference
      - Don't save references to this. Use arrow functions or Function#bind. jscs: disallowNodeTypes
    - File naming
      - If your file exports a single class, your filename should be exactly the name of the class.

  - [navigator scaffold 4](https://i.imgur.com/Km8Wcl5.png)

- **Step 1: init a new project**

```bash
# @filename: projectFolder
npx react-native init tracker --npm  #plain RN project
npx react-native init whatProjectName --template react-native-template-typescript --npm #RN + TS project
npx expo-cli init myProjectName --npm   #project with template option

# using npx expo-cli init projectName --npm to init a project
? Choose a template: › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    ----- Managed workflow -----
    blank               a minimal app as clean as an empty canvas
    blank (TypeScript)  same as blank but with TypeScript configuration
❯   tabs (TypeScript)   several example screens and tabs using react-navigation and TypeScript
    ----- Bare workflow -----
    minimal             bare and minimal, just the essentials to get you started

✔ Choose a template: › tabs (TypeScript)   several example screens and tabs using react-navigation and TypeScript
✔ Downloaded template.
📦 Using npm to install packages.
✔ Installed JavaScript dependencies.

✅ Your project is ready!

To run your project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following npm commands.

- cd tracker
- npm start # you can open iOS, Android, or web from here, or run them directly with the commands below.
- npm run android
- npm run ios # requires an iOS device or macOS for access to an iOS simulator
- npm run web
```

```bash
# @filename: projectFolder/tracker
mkdir src
cd src
mkdir screens
cd screens

# @filename: projectFolder/tracker/src/screens
touch SignupScreen.tsx SigninScreen.tsx AccountScreen.tsx TrackCreateScreen.tsx TrackListScreen.tsx TrackDetailScreen.tsx
```

- **step 2: boilerplate all the 6 newly created screens file**
  - use shorthand **tsrnfs** boilerplate

- **step 3: write import statement for all files from screens folder to app.tsx**

- **step 4: navigation hookup (stitch navigator together)**
  - 4.1 import _[React](https://www.nightprogrammer.com/tutorial/what-does-import-react-from-react-mean/)_ from react
    - import: I am asking React to import other dependencies or packages from the same project in your current file
    - React: The name of the variable where all the imported code is assigned into
    - from: It tells React from where it should take all the code from
    - 'react': It is the name of the package (it should be a valid name)
  - 4.2 wrap the whole app with _[NavigationContainer](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started)_ inside my entry file: app.tsx
  - 4.3 _[createNativeStackNavigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator/)_ provides a way for my app to transition between screens where each new screen is placed on top of a stack
  - 4.4 _[createBottomTabNavigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/)_ simple tab bar on the bottom of the screen that lets you switch between different routes
  - 4.5 assign _[Creating Native Stack Navigator](https://anothertechs.com/programming/react-native/react-native-navigation-stack/)_ function to a whatever-i-name-it variable
    - **createNativeStackNavigator()** is a function that returns an object with two properties: Screen and Navigator
  - 4.6 assign _[createBottomTabNavigator()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/react-native-tab-navigation-component/)_ function to a whatever-i-name-it variable
    - **createBottomTabNavigator()** is a function that is used for navigation from one page to another
      - **Props in Tab Navigation:**
        - initialRouteName: It is the initial route that opens when the application loads.
        - order: It basically sets the order of the tabs.
        - paths: It controls the mapping of the route screen to path config.
        - lazy: If its value is true, then the tab is rendered when it becomes active for the first time. Its default value is true.
        - tabBarComponent: It is an optional prop. It overrides the component which is used as a tab bar.
        - tabBarOptions: It is an object of many properties like tabStyle , showLabel, showIcon, style, etc…
- see example below:

```TypeScript
// @filename: ./projectFolder/tracker/App.tsx

// 4.1 import react core modules
import React from 'react';

// 4.2 import React Navigation v6 components
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
// 4.3 import Native Stack Navigator
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack'
// 4.4 import Bottom Tabs Navigator
import { createBottomTabNavigator } from '@react-navigation/bottom-tabs';


// 3.1 import from screens folder to here
import SigninScreen from './src/screens/SigninScreen';
import SignupScreen from './src/screens/SignupScreen';
import AccountScreen from './src/screens/AccountScreen';
import TrackCreateScreen from './src/screens/TrackCreateScreen';

- **step 7: Styling Odds & Ends**
  - [Logic](https://i.imgur.com/ZXCssTX.png)
  - 7.1 hide header of signup screen
    - [screenOption](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/screen-options/)
    - using **options={{ headerShown: false }}** to hide header
      - instead of adding _headerShown: false_ to each screen's option, I can add screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }} to the navigator to set the option for all of the screens
    - [Hide Header Bar on Specific Screens](https://www.kindacode.com/article/react-navigation-5-x-hiding-the-header-bar-on-a-specific-screen/)
  - use <View> instead of <> fragment tag so I can apply some styling

## So do I know now?

- **JARGON in laymen terms:**
  - [export default App;](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36426521/what-does-export-default-do-in-jsx/36426988#36426988)
  - A module is a self contained unit that can expose assets to other modules using export, and acquire assets from other modules using import
  - **Default export**
    - is the value that will be imported from the module, if I use the simple import statement import X from 'module'
    - X is the name that will be given locally to the variable assigned to contain the value, and it doesn't have to be named like the origin export
    - There can be only one default export.
  - **Named exports**
    - for example export function func() {} is a named export with the name of func
    - Named modules can be imported using import { exportName } from 'module';
    - In this case, the name of the import should be the same as the name of the export
    - To import the func in the example, you'll have to use import { func } from 'module';
    - There can be multiple named exports in one module
  - A module can contain both named exports and a default export, and they can be imported together using:
    - **import defaultExport**
    - **{ namedExport1, namedExport3, etc... } from 'module';**
  - [navigation prop](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-prop)
    - This [prop](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/glossary-of-terms#screen-component) will be passed to all screens, and it can be used for the following:
      - dispatch will send an action up to the router
      - navigate, goBack, etc are available to dispatch actions in a convenient way
  - Navigators can also accept a navigation prop, which they should get from the parent navigator, if there is one
  - [React Fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html)
    - A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements
    - Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Try to code with lesser research and reference, embrace learning through failures, next 4 week to train myself yellow duck methods.
- Code with think aloud methods.
- Time Management
  - Where is the balance between learn, work, life and rest.
- Slow typing speed
  - How to speed up typing speed?
- Reading speed
  - Comprehended the logic but not the code.
- Memory skills
  - What causing me to lose my memory?
- "Make it Better" <== my personal workflow
  - learn to throw away code and start over again will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub.
- Logic & analytical thinking:
  - I should find a way to think in logical frames to solve problems.
  - important to have strong logical and analytical thinking  capabilities to decide which language or piece of code best suited for each user story.
- Detail-oriented:
  - how to ensure the precise accuracy in writing pieces of code?
  - important to have strong attention to detail to protect my work, remain efficient and prevent bugs.
- Creativity:
  - learn to recognize the potential for technological solutions to everyday problems.
  - important to understand how React Native + TypeScript works, the more creative ways to solve potential problems.
- Resourcefulness + independence:
  - able to complete individual tasks and later combine them together with other.
  - important to remain resourceful and to habe confidence in my own ability to find a solution to any coding problem that might arise.
- Curiosity:
  - important to remain curious about coding and various languages and technologies.
- Time-boxing to strict 90 minutes per task with a 20min rest break.

- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.

- Required improvement on technical writing of learning experience and daily lesson task reviews with a better layout.

- Read 1 chapter / 30min of Computational Thinking.

- add one more column for non-technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- try to practice these 9 principles for 52 weeks:
  1. Understand the Basics;
  2. Write Easy To Understand And Logical Programming Codes
  3. Try Analyzing my Code
  4. Read As Many Books I Can
  5. Talking to a fellow programmer
  6. Help others In Solving Their Problems
  7. Contribution to Open Source and Signing-up mailing lists
  8. Practice It Many Times As Possible
  9. Participate In Different Events

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

==============================================================================

## MY GOAL for May
