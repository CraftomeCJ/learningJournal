# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude 
-->
<!-- Week 23:
Love Unconditionally:
  I give my love freely to my wife for the joy and thrill of knowing that she will be joyous and free.
  My gift of love has no strings attached. It is as free as the wind.
  I expect nothing in return, because the ability to feel and express love is an incredible gift itself.
  I rejoice in the happiness that my love gives to me and others.
-->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Intention and Desire: **"Make a list of desires"**<br/>
Inherent in every intention and desire is the mechanics for its fulfillment. <br/>
Trust that when things don't seem to go my way, there is a reason. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Intention and Desire into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. I will make a list of all my desires. I will carry this list with me whenever I go. I will look at it before I go to sleep at night. I will look at it when I wake up in the morning. 
  2. I will release this list of my desires and surrender it to the womb of creation, trusting that when things don't seem to go my way, there is a reason, and that the cosmic plan has designs for me much grander than even those I have conceived.
  3. I will remind myself to practice present-moment awareness in all my actions. I will refuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate the quality of the attention in the present moment. I will accept the present as it is, and manifest the future through my deepest, most cherished intentions and desires.
-->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
<!-- JUNE 2022: The Divine Craft
Mastering The Arts Of Indirection And Manipulation:
  The month of June will teach me how to make people bend to my will without their realizing what I have done.
  And if they do not realize what I have done, they will neither resent nor resist me.
 -->
_Give People the Opportunity to Feel Superior_ <br/>
I must figure out what makes others tick. <br/>
When they ooze greed, appeal to their greed. When they want to look charitable and noble, appeal to their charity. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man always said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Nothing is a waste of time if you use the experience wisely" - Rodin <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful for: Kind coworkers** Working somewhere where everybody is nice is quite a luxury. <br/>

<!-- what has holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Uncomfortable Feelings that Actually Indicate I'm on the Right Path <br/>
_A life-changing event is taking place or just has_ <br/>
For example: I suddenly having to move, getting divorced, losing a job, having a car break down, etc. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- Keep asking the "5 WHYs?"
  Qns 1. Why the problem is occurring?
  Qns 2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  Qns 3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  Qns 4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  Qns 5. Why on answer of Qns 4
- Find the root cause the answer to Qns 5 should be the root cause I should address
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When would this work?
- Where would this work?
- How to solve the problem?
-->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [x] Ask myself: If today was the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today? <br/>When I need to make the choices in my life, asking myself: "will this simplify my life, get me closer to my goals, inspire someone or bring happiness". The answer should leads the way.<br/>
- [x] What was the worst punishment that I had during my childhood? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work.
These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day.
-->
<!--
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
-->
<!-- How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
  1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
  2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
  3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
  4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved.
==> reading book now become associated with feeling stalled at programming.
-->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs:
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!-- What is Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. Activities only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!-- What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!--Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

<!-- Coding as a Career -->
<!--Learn to remind myself how much I have to learn!!!
-->
<!--Learn to stop trying to prove myself right:
  - Question myself how I can make this better?
  - actively seeking for where I am wrong?
-->
<!--Learn to understand when "the code works" isn't where I stop; it is where the fun start!!
  - step 1 ==> always write quality code that fulfils the spec
  - step 2 ==> Now, make it better!!!
    1. Is it valuable to make it faster?
    2. Is it easier to document?
    3. Is it more reusable?
    4. Is it more reliable?
-->
<!--Learn to write the code THREE times:
  - First time ==> write the software to prove myself that these solution is possible
  - Second time ==> make it work
  - Third time ==> make it work right
  - Learn to throw away code and all start over again, it will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub
-->
<!--Learn to Read Code, Read lots of Code:
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I have seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it is open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style
  - Write out my answer in personal journal
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!!
-->
<!--Learn to write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. it give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. it makes me more marketable
    3. it help me gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. with personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
  - it also force me to figure things out on my own
  - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn
-->
<!--Learn to work one-on-one with other developers any way I can:
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms?
-->
<!--Learn to learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check
-->

<!-- Strategies that will help me to push through beginner phase:
  1. I will continue to make programs from scratch:
    - start writing my own code, without instruction
    - start with an empty file, and type every line of code myself
    - look at other people's code
    - analyse other people's code
      - try to figure out how it works, then write it myself
  2. I will start small, very small:
    - make something that would be useful in real life
    - start with load of text-based games, time tracker, to-do list, or something to automate calculations
    - use these projects to learn all of the features of JavaScript, React, and TypeScript
  3. write lots of code:
    - I have to make software to gain skill
    - the program I make will not do much, and it will probably have messy code, but that doesn't matter
    - read some theory, get some advice, and make a new program
    - each program I make should be bigger and better than the last
    - Repeat these steps for long enough, and I will become an expert
  4. Seek for help:
    - it's OK to ask for help only if I do these:
      - always try to google my problem first
      - analyse the answer and learn the cause behind my error
        - with this way, when I encounter the same error again, I already know how to fix it
    - If I constantly hitting unsolvable problems, that probably means that my project is too ambitious
    - Scale it back, and make something smaller until my skills improve
  5. Seeking help the right way:
    - **paste in my exact error message**
      - this is the most important piece of information
    - if there is no error message, **explain what I expected to happen, and what actually happened**
      - something like "I expect it to output 5, but it actually outputs 7"
      - Often, the problem is not in my code, it is in my expectations
      - If I don't explain what I expected, I will get answers like "the code looks fine" and "what is the problem?"
    - **paste in my broken code**
      - It is very difficult to debug a problem without seeing the code
      - paste it all in, if it's not too big, because people will run my code to investigate the problem
      - If there is too much code, paste it into a Github Gist or Pastebin.com, then put the link into my question
    - **format my code correctly**
      - don't just paste in the code like normal text
      - master how to format the code nicely so it is easy to read

```python
# It should look like this:

def foobar
  puts 1 + 2 / 3
end
```

```python
# Not like this:

def foobar
puts 1+2/3
end
```

    - **mention what I have already tried**
      - this tells people that I have already put in some effort
    - **try to use correct terminology**
      - make an effort to learn the common terms, and use them correctly

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where I write down work that comes up:
For example: wife need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help
  - My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to my Outcome-Based Goals 
  ==> the work I planned to get done have top priorities

## Personal Notes

- **REMEMBER: I don't become a programmer from tutorial, reading codes or books. I become a programmer WHEN I AM DOING the coding (It doesn't matter how many line I write, How bad/good each block of code look like)**

**Day 68 (Friday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday I will be continue redoing tracker app, read on Unit Test, define programming terminology, and try to understand tech jargon in layman term, so study more on how to split the screen into sub components and how to do state management, that's is more important. Try to master the workflow. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done.
This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal.
-->
<!-- My Foundation -->
- **Fundamental**
- [The five basic elements](https://study.com/academy/lesson/5-basic-elements-of-programming.html), in programming are:
  - **Input**: getting data and commands into the computer
  - **Output**: getting your results out of the computer
  - **Variables and Data Structures**: storing information, which may change over time
  - **Mathematical Operations (Arithmetic)**: performing mathematical calculations on my data
  - **Looping and Conditionals**: testing to see if a condition is true of false, and cycling through a set of instructions until some condition is met

- [Turning Problems into Code](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)
- **As much as 70% of my time should be spent in steps 1-3 & 10**
  - **10 steps guidelines which I can use for any [programming problem](https://codeburst.io/10-steps-to-solving-a-programming-problem-8a32d1e96d74):**
<!-- see day 20220604 notes -->
  1. Read the problem several times until I can explain it to someone else

  2. Solve the problem manually test it with 4 sets of sample data

  3. Optimize the manual steps, make it better

  4. Write the manual steps as pseudo-code or comments

  5. Replace the pseudo-code or comments into real code

  6. Simplify and optimize the real code
<!-- - _some questions I can ask myself:_
  - What are my goals for simplifying and optimizing?
  - Am I trying to condense the code as much as possible?
  - Is the goal to make the code more readable?
  - How else can I make the code more readable?
  - Are there any more extra steps I can take out?
  - Are there any variables or functions I ended up not even needing or using?
  - Am I repeating some steps a lot?
  - Can I define in another function?
  - Are there better ways to handle edge cases?
-->
  7. Debug
<!-- - _some techniques I can use:_
  - Check the console to see what the error message says
  - Comment out chunks or lines of code and output what I have so far to quickly see if the code is behaving how I expected
  - Use other sample data if there are scenarios I did not think of and see if the code will still work
  - Save different versions of my file if I am trying out a completely different approach -->
  8. Write some useful comments
<!-- 
  - Try to write brief, high-level comments that help me understand what's going on if it is not obvious
  - This comes in handy when I am working on more complex problems
  - It helps understand what a particular function is doing and why
  - Through the use of clear variable names, function names, and comments, I (or others) should be able to understand:
    - What is this code for?
    - What is it doing?
-->
  9. Get feedback through code reviews
  
  10. Practice, practice, practice

- Facing any complex challenge/problems, **writing actual code is only a small part of the process:**
  - I must divide the problem before any attempt to solve it
  - **Step1:** Understanding the problem: _Follow 10 step guidelines 10.1_
    - breaking large problem down into smaller parts/features
    - try to figure out what I have to do is to write it down, draw a diagram, or tell someone else or yellow duck about it
    - [During gathering requirements phase,](https://www.bridging-the-gap.com/what-questions-do-i-ask-during-requirements-elicitation/) ask questions:
    - **Always Ask "FIVE WHYs":**
      - Why a specific problem is occurring, or what I am trying to solve and note the main reason:
      - Qns 1: Why is this main reason exists?
      - Qns 2: Why on answer of Qns 1?
      - Qns 3: Why on answer of Qns 2?
      - Qns 4: Why on answer of Qns 3?
      - Qns 5: Why on answer of Qns 4?
      - Answer to question 5 should be the root cause I should address

  - **Step 2:** Planning the solution
    - Once I have the answers to my questions, try write out a _problem statement_ that explain exactly what I am doing
    - If I have a clear problem statement, look at the nouns and verbs in the statement.
    - **NOUNS** - will become my inputs and outputs
    - **VERBS** - will be my processes
<!-- - For example: Create a simple tip calculator:
  - The program should prompt for a bill amount and a tip rate.
  - The program must compute the tip and then display both the tip and the total amount of the bill.
- Look at the nouns. (make a list of it)
  - bill amount
  - tip rate
  - tip
  - total amount
- Look at the verbs. (make a list of it)
  - prompt
  - compute
  - display
-->
- **Problem statement questionnaires:**
  - What's the context?
  - When would this work?
  - Where would this work?
  - Who does this benefit?
  - How to solve the problem?
    1. What is the problem or what problem does it solve?
    2. What do I need to know to and use to build this application?
    3. What is the inputs?
    4. What is the processes?
    5. What is the outputs?
    6. What does the solution should look like? etc. etc.
  - Prioritize if there are multiple root causes by:
    1. urgency
    2. size of impact
    3. subsequent problems solved
    4. dependency
    5. ease of resolution

  - **Step 3:** Testing the program, _Follow guidelines 10.2_
    - Always think about the result I want to get right from the start using a process called _test-driven development (TDD)_
    - **KEY "TDD" CONCEPTS:** - is to think about the expected result of the program is ahead of time and then work toward getting there
    - by creating a test plans that lists the program's input and its expected result

  - **STep 4:** Writing the algorithm in pseudocode, _Follow guidelines 10.4_
    - Algorithm is a step by step set of operations that need to be performed
    - If I take an algorithm and write code to perform those operations, I end up with a computer program

  - **Step 5:** Writing the code, _Follow guidelines 10.5 onwards_

- [Computer Programming - Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_basics.htm)
- [Programming Terminology](https://careerkarma.com/blog/programming-terminology/)

- [Naming Conventions](https://unional.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/pages/default/draft/naming-conventions.html)
  - Single letter names
    - Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming.
  - Name casing
    - Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances. eslint: camelCase jscs: requireCamelCaseOrUpperCaseIdentifiers
    - Use PascalCase when naming constructors or classes. eslint: new-cap jscs: requireCapitalizedConstructors
    - Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function's name.
    - Use PascalCase when you export a singleton / function library / bare object.
  - Name prefixes
    - Use a leading underscore _ when naming private properties. eslint: no-underscore-dangle jscs: disallowDanglingUnderscores
  - this reference
    - Don't save references to this. Use arrow functions or Function#bind. jscs: disallowNodeTypes
  - File naming
    - If your file exports a single class, your filename should be exactly the name of the class.

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection.
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority.

ASK Myself During This Time:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=> How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=> What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=> Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work.
This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review.

<!-- Review for June 2022 -->
- Try to code with lesser research and reference, embrace learning through failures, next 4 week to train myself more on yellow duck methods.
- Code with think aloud methods.
<!-- Novice level Keep reading, practice-->
- [Time Management](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-rule-of-52-and-17-its-random-but-it-ups-your-productivity)
  - Time-boxing to strict 52 minutes per task with a 17min rest break for maximum productivity.
  - What is the ratio for learn, work, life and rest.
<!-- work(0%) : learn(60%) : life(15%) : rest(25%) -->
- Slow typing speed
  - How to speed up typing speed?
<!-- 23 words per minutes -->
- Reading speed
  - Comprehended the logic but not the code
<!-- 130 words per minutes -->
- Memory skills
  - What causing me to lose my memory?
<!-- Learn mnemonic technique and retrieve practice with flashcards -->
- "Make it Better" <== Personal Flow on programming skills
  - Learn to throw away code and start over again will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub
<!-- more room to improve in this area, lack of project completion, can't code without tutorial, low in language understanding keep practicing-->
- [Logic & Analytical Thinking:](https://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/analytical-thinking/)
  - I should find a way to think in logical frames to solve problems
  - Important to have strong logical and analytical thinking  capabilities to decide which language or piece of code best suited for each user story.
<!-- Play 1 expert level sudoku daily -->
- Detail-oriented:
  - How to ensure the precise accuracy in writing pieces of code?
  - Important to have strong attention to detail to protect my work, remain efficient and prevent bugs.
- Creativity:
  - Learn to recognize the potential for technological solutions to everyday problems.
  - Important to understand how React Native + TypeScript works, the more creative ways to solve potential problems.
- Resourcefulness + independence:
  - Able to complete individual tasks and later combine them together with other.
  - Important to remain resourceful and to have confidence in my own ability to find a solution to any coding problem that might arise.
- Curiosity:
  - Important to remain curious about coding and various languages and technologies.
- Other Improvement:
- required many more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie type, enum, interface and extends for type protection.
- Read 4-5pages of Selected Tech book daily and write a review on what I had understand and put learning point into flashcards for retrieve practices.
- add one more column for non-technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- I will try to practice these 9 principles for next 48 weeks:
  1. Understand the Basics;
  2. Write Easy To Understand And Logical Programming Codes
  3. Try Analyzing my Code
  4. Read As Many Books I Can
  5. Talking to a fellow programmer
  6. Help others In Solving Their Problems
  7. Contribution to Open Source and Signing-up mailing lists
  8. Practice It Many Times As Possible
  9. Participate In Different Events

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month.
For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus"
  ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only.
