# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 23:
Love Unconditionally:
  I give my love freely to my wife for the joy and thrill of knowing that she will be joyous and free.
  My gift of love has no strings attached. It is as free as the wind.
  I expect nothing in return, because the ability to feel and express love is an incredible gift itself.
  I rejoice in the happiness that my love gives to me and others.
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Pure Potentiality: **"Maybe!" => Illustrate the wisdom of non-judgement**<br/>
Take time to be silent, to just BE. <br/>
Meditate for 22 minutes twice per day. <br/>
Silently witness the intelligence within every living thing. Practice non-judgement. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Pure Potentiality into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. I will get in touch with the field of pure potentiality by taking time each day to be silent, to just BE. I will also sit alone in silent meditation at least twice a day for approximately 22 minutes in the morning and 22 minutes in the evening. 
  2. I will take time each day to interact with nature and to silently witness the intelligence within every living thing. I will sit silently and watch a sunset, or listen to the sound of the ocean or a stream, or simply smell the scent of a flower. In the ecstasy of my own silence, and by interacting with nature, I will enjoy the lire throb of ages, the field of pure potentiality and unlimited creativity.
  3. I will practice non-judgement. I will begin my day with this statement: "Today, I shall judge nothing that occurs, and reply "MAYBE!" to all opinion-seeking suggestions by others," and throughout the day I will remind myself not to judge.
-->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
<!-- JUNE 2022: The Divine Craft
Mastering The Arts Of Indirection And Manipulation:
  The month of June will teach me how to make people bend to my will without their realizing what I have done.
  And if they do not realize what I have done, they will neither resent nor resist me.
 -->
_Create Dramatic Effects_ <br/>
Use theatrical timing to surprise and divert. <br/>
Learn to orchestrate events, never revealing all my cards at once, but unfolding them in a way that heightens their dramatic effect. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man always said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Know the true value of time; snatch, seize, and enjoy every moment of it. <br/>
No idleness, no laziness, no procrastination; Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today." - Lord Chesterfield <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful for:** never allowing negative situations to sweep me away, you have been a faithful Father who has always kept to His word. Thank you for your faithfulness. <br/>

<!-- what has holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Uncomfortable Feelings that Actually Indicate I'm on the Right Path <br/>
_Feeling "lost" or directionless._ <br/>
Feeling lost is actually a sign I am becoming more present in my life -- I am living less within the narratives and ideas that I premeditated and more in the moment at hand. <br/>
Until I am used to this, it will feel as though I am off track **(Remember: I AM NOT)**. <br/>


<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When would this work?
- Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [x] Ask myself: How have I helped someone else recently? <br/>
- [x] What is my favorite thing to do during my free time? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

<!-- Coding as a Career -->
<!-- learn remind myself how much I have to learn -->
<!-- learn stop trying to prove myself right
  - ask myself how I can make this better?
  - actively look for where I am wrong? -->
<!-- learn "the code works" isn't where I stop; it's where I start!!
  - step 1 ==> always write quality code that fulfils the spec
  - step 2 ==> Now, make it better!!
    1. Is it valuable to make it faster?
    2. easier to document?
    3. more reusable?
    4. more reliable? -->
<!-- learn write it THREE times
  - First time ==> write the software to prove myself that the solution is possible;
  - Second time ==> make it work
  - Third time ==> make it work right
  - throw away code and start over will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub. -->
<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

<!-- Strategies that help me to push through beginner phase:
  - I will continue to make programs from scratch
    - start writing my own code, without instruction
    - start with an empty file, and type every line of code myself
    - look at other people's code
    - Analyse other people's code
    - learn a little bit about how it works, then write it myself
  - I will start small, very small
    - make something that would be useful in real life
    - start with load of make text-based games, time tracker, to-do list, or something to automate calculations
    - use these projects to learn all of the features of JavaScript, React, and TypeScript
  - write lots of code
    - I have to make software to gain skill
    - The program I make will not do much, and it will probably have messy code, but that doesn't matter
    - read some theory, get some advice, and make a new program
    - each program I make should be bigger and better than the last
    - Repeat these steps for long enough, and I will become an expert
  - ask for help
    - it's OK to ask for help only if I do these:
      - always try to google my problem first
      - analyse the answer and learn the cause behind my error
      - this way, when I encounter the same error again, I will already know how to fix it
    - If I constantly hitting unsolvable problems, that probably means that my project is too ambitious
    - Scale it back, and make something smaller until my skills improve
  - asking help the right way
    - **paste in my exact error message**
      - this is the most important piece of information
    - if there is no error message, **explain what I expected to happen, and what actually happened**
      - something like "I expect it to output 5, but it actually outputs 7"
      - Often, the problem isn't in my code, it's in my expectations
      - If I don't explain what I expected, I will get answers like "the code looks fine" and "what is the problem?"
    - **paste in my broken code**
      - It's very difficult to debug a problem without seeing the code
      - paste it all in, if it's not too big, because people will run my code to investigate the problem
      - If there is too much code, paste it into a Github Gist or Pastebin.com, then put the link into my question
    - **format my code correctly**
      - don't just paste in my code like normal text
      - learn how to format my code nicely so it is easy to read

```python
# It should look like this:

def foobar
  puts 1 + 2 / 3
end
```

```python
# Not like this:

def foobar
puts 1+2/3
end
```

- **mention what I have already tried**
  - this tells people that I've already put in some effort.

- **try to use correct terminology**
  - make an effort to learn the common terms, and use them correctly.

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to my Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->
1. [Try Completing A Personal React Native + Typescript Operation Manual Ver 1.2](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/Template_RN_TS_Metro/blob/main/MANUAL.md)
2. TBC

## Personal Notes

- **REMEMBER: I don't become a programmer from reading codes or books. I become a programmer ONLY WHEN I DO the coding (doesn't matter how many line I write, how bad/good each block of code look like)**

**Day 63 (Sunday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday will be building tracking app, breakdown SHARE Nx structure, define programming terminology, read on Unit Test. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
- **Fundamental**
- [The five basic elements](https://study.com/academy/lesson/5-basic-elements-of-programming.html), in programming are:
  - **Input**: getting data and commands into the computer
  - **Output**: getting your results out of the computer
  - **Variables and data structures**: storing information, which may change over time
  - **Mathematical operations (arithmetic)**: Performing mathematical calculations on your data
  - **Looping and conditionals**: testing to see if a condition is true of false, and cycling through a set of instructions until some condition is met

- [Turning Problems into Code](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)
- **As much as 70% of my time should be spent in steps 1-3 & 10**
  - **10 steps guidelines which I can use for any [programming problem](https://codeburst.io/10-steps-to-solving-a-programming-problem-8a32d1e96d74):**
<!-- see day 20220604 notes -->
  1. Read the problem several times until I can explain it to someone else
  2. Solve the problem manually. example with 4 sets of sample data
  3. Optimize the manual steps, make it better
  4. Write the manual steps as pseudo-code or comments
  5. Replace the pseudo-code or comments into code and debug
  6. Simplify and optimize the real code
    - _some questions I can ask myself:_
    - What are my goals for simplifying and optimizing?
    - Am I trying to condense the code as much as possible?
    - Is the goal to make the code more readable?
    - How else can I make the code more readable?
    - Are there any more extra steps I can take out?
    - Are there any variables or functions I ended up not even needing or using?
    - Am I repeating some steps a lot?
    - Can I define in another function?
    - Are there better ways to handle edge cases?
  7. Debug
    - _some techniques I can use:_
      - Check the console to see what the error message says
      - Comment out chunks or lines of code and output what I have so far to quickly see if the code is behaving how I expected
      - Use other sample data if there are scenarios I did not think of and see if the code will still work
      - Save different versions of my file if I am trying out a completely different approach
  8. Write some useful comments
    - Try to write brief, high-level comments that help me understand what's going on if it is not obvious
    - This comes in handy when I am working on more complex problems
    - It helps understand what a particular function is doing and why
    - Through the use of clear variable names, function names, and comments, I (or others) should be able to understand:
      - What is this code for?
      - What is it doing?
  9. Get feedback through code reviews
  10. Practice, practice, practice

- **Writing actual code is only a small part of the process:**
  - I must divide the problem before any attempt to solve it
  - **Step1:** Understanding the problem, _Follow guidelines 10.1_
    - Breaking large problem down into smaller parts/features
    - to figure out what I have to do is to write it down, draw a diagram, or tell someone else or yellow duck about it
    - [During gathering requirements phase,](https://www.bridging-the-gap.com/what-questions-do-i-ask-during-requirements-elicitation/) ask questions:
    - **Ask "FIVE WHYs":**
      - Why a specific problem is occurring? and note the main reason
      - Q1: Why is this main reason exists?
      - Q2: Why on answer of Qns 1?
      - Q3: Why on answer of Qns 2?
      - Q4: Why on answer of Qns 3?
      - Q5: Why on answer of Qns 4?
      - Answer to question 5 should be the root cause I should address

  - **Step 2:** Planning the solution
    - Once I have the answers to my questions, try write out a _problem statement_ that explain exactly what I'm building
    - If I have a clear problem statement, look at the nouns and verbs in the statement.
    - **NOUNS** - will become my inputs and outputs
    - **VERBS** - will be my processes
    - **Problem statement questionnaires:**
    - What's the context?
    - When would this work?
    - Where would this work?
    - Who does this benefit?
    - How to solve the problem?
      1. What is the problem or problem does it solve?
      2. What do I need to know to and use to build this application?
      3. What is the inputs?
      4. What is the processes?
      5. What is the outputs?
      6. What does the solution should look like? etc. etc.
  - Prioritize if there are multiple root causes by:
    1. urgency
    2. size of impact
    3. subsequent problems solved
    4. dependency
    5. ease of resolution

  - **Step 3:** Testing the program, _Follow guidelines 10.2_
    - Always think about the result I want to get right from the start using a process called _test-driven development (TDD)_
    - **KEY "TDD" CONCEPTS:** - is to think about the expected result of the program is ahead of time and then work toward getting there
    - by creating a test plans that lists the program's input and its expected result

  - **STep 4:** Writing the algorithm in pseudocode, _Follow guidelines 10.4_
    - Algorithm is a step by step set of operations that need to be performed
    - If I take an algorithm and write code to perform those operations, I end up with a computer program

  - **Step 5:** Writing the code, _Follow guidelines 10.5 onwards_

- [Computer Programming - Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_basics.htm)
- [Programming Terminology](https://careerkarma.com/blog/programming-terminology/)

- [Naming Conventions](https://unional.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/pages/default/draft/naming-conventions.html)
  - Single letter names
    - Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming.
  - Name casing
    - Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances. eslint: camelCase jscs: requireCamelCaseOrUpperCaseIdentifiers
    - Use PascalCase when naming constructors or classes. eslint: new-cap jscs: requireCapitalizedConstructors
    - Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function's name.
    - Use PascalCase when you export a singleton / function library / bare object.
  - Name prefixes
    - Use a leading underscore _ when naming private properties. eslint: no-underscore-dangle jscs: disallowDanglingUnderscores
  - this reference
    - Don't save references to this. Use arrow functions or Function#bind. jscs: disallowNodeTypes
  - File naming
    - If your file exports a single class, your filename should be exactly the name of the class.

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Try to code with lesser research and reference, embrace learning through failures, next 4 week to train myself yellow duck methods.
- Code with think aloud methods.
- Time Management
  - Where is the balance between learn, work, life and rest.
- Slow typing speed
  - How to speed up typing speed?
- Reading speed
  - Comprehended the logic but not the code.
- Memory skills
  - What causing me to lose my memory?
- "Make it Better" <== my personal workflow
  - learn to throw away code and start over again will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub.
- Logic & analytical thinking:
  - I should find a way to think in logical frames to solve problems.
  - important to have strong logical and analytical thinking  capabilities to decide which language or piece of code best suited for each user story.
- Detail-oriented:
  - how to ensure the precise accuracy in writing pieces of code?
  - important to have strong attention to detail to protect my work, remain efficient and prevent bugs.
- Creativity:
  - learn to recognize the potential for technological solutions to everyday problems.
  - important to understand how React Native + TypeScript works, the more creative ways to solve potential problems.
- Resourcefulness + independence:
  - able to complete individual tasks and later combine them together with other.
  - important to remain resourceful and to habe confidence in my own ability to find a solution to any coding problem that might arise.
- Curiosity:
  - important to remain curious about coding and various languages and technologies.
- Time-boxing to strict 90 minutes per task with a 20min rest break.

- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.

- Required improvement on technical writing of learning experience and daily lesson task reviews with a better layout.

- Read 1 chapter / 30min of Computational Thinking.

- add one more column for non-technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->
