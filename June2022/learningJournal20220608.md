# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude 
-->
<!-- Week 23:
Love Unconditionally:
  I give my love freely to my wife for the joy and thrill of knowing that she will be joyous and free.
  My gift of love has no strings attached. It is as free as the wind.
  I expect nothing in return, because the ability to feel and express love is an incredible gift itself.
  I rejoice in the happiness that my love gives to me and others.
-->
**Law of Life:**<br/>
The Law of Least Effort: **"Is that so?" Apply the Power of Non-Resistance**<br/>
Shows the good through inner non-resistance. <br/>
Accept people, situations and events as they occur. Take responsibility for my situation and for all events seen as problems. <br/>
Relinquish the need to defend my point of view. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Least Effort into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. I will practice Acceptance. Today I will accept people, situations and events as they occur. I will know that this moment is as it should be, because the whole universe is as it should be. I will not struggle against the whole universe by struggling against this moment. My acceptance is total and complete. I accept things as they are this moment, not as I wish they were.
  2. Having accepted things as they are, I will take Responsibility for my situation and for all those events I see as problems. I know that taking responsibility means not blaming anyone or anything for my situation (and this includes myself). I also know that every problem is an opportunity in disguise, and this alertness to opportunities allows me to take this moment and transform it into a greater benefit.
  3. Today my awareness will remain established in Defenselessness. I will give up the need to defend my point of view. I will feel no need to convince or persuade others to accept my point of view. I will remain open to all view and not be rigidly attached to any one of them.-->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
<!-- JUNE 2022: The Divine Craft
Mastering The Arts Of Indirection And Manipulation:
  The month of June will teach me how to make people bend to my will without their realizing what I have done.
  And if they do not realize what I have done, they will neither resent nor resist me.
 -->
_Distract Them from My Real Goal_ <br/>
Seem to want something in which I am actually not at all interested and my enemies will be thrown off the scent, making all kinds of errors in their calculations. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man always said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Leaders aren't born, they are made. <br/>
And they are made just like anything else, through hard work. <br/>
And that's the price we'll have to pay to achieve that goal, or any goal." - Vince Lombardi <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful for: Being able to trust someone.** I may have had a tough time trusting people throughout my life. I am glad now I have someone I can completely trust. <br/>

<!-- what has holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Uncomfortable Feelings that Actually Indicate I'm on the Right Path <br/>
_Experiencing unpredictable and scattered sleeping patterns._ <br/>
I'll need to sleep a lot more or a lot less, I'll wake up in the middle of the night because I cannot stop thinking about something, <br/>
I find myself full of energy or completely exhausted, and with little in between. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- Keep asking the "5 WHYs?"
  Qns 1. Why the problem is occurring?
  Qns 2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  Qns 3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  Qns 4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  Qns 5. Why on answer of Qns 4
- Find the root cause the answer to Qns 5 should be the root cause I should address
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When would this work?
- Where would this work?
- How to solve the problem?
-->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [x] Ask myself: How am I pursuing my dreams right now? <br/>
- [x] What bores me to death the most? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work.
These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day.
-->
<!--
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
-->
<!-- How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
  1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
  2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
  3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
  4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved.
==> reading book now become associated with feeling stalled at programming.
-->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs:
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!-- What is Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. Activities only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!-- What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!--Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

<!-- Coding as a Career -->
<!--Learn to remind myself how much I have to learn!!!
-->
<!--Learn to stop trying to prove myself right:
  - Question myself how I can make this better?
  - actively seeking for where I am wrong?
-->
<!--Learn to understand when "the code works" isn't where I stop; it is where the fun start!!
  - step 1 ==> always write quality code that fulfils the spec
  - step 2 ==> Now, make it better!!!
    1. Is it valuable to make it faster?
    2. Is it easier to document?
    3. Is it more reusable?
    4. Is it more reliable?
-->
<!--Learn to write the code THREE times:
  - First time ==> write the software to prove myself that these solution is possible
  - Second time ==> make it work
  - Third time ==> make it work right
  - Learn to throw away code and all start over again, it will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub
-->
<!--Learn to Read Code, Read lots of Code:
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I have seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it is open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style
  - Write out my answer in personal journal
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!!
-->
<!--Learn to write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. it give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. it makes me more marketable
    3. it help me gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. with personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
  - it also force me to figure things out on my own
  - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn
-->
<!--Learn to work one-on-one with other developers any way I can:
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms?
-->
<!--Learn to learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check
-->

<!-- Strategies that will help me to push through beginner phase:
  1. I will continue to make programs from scratch:
    - start writing my own code, without instruction
    - start with an empty file, and type every line of code myself
    - look at other people's code
    - analyse other people's code
      - try to figure out how it works, then write it myself
  2. I will start small, very small:
    - make something that would be useful in real life
    - start with load of text-based games, time tracker, to-do list, or something to automate calculations
    - use these projects to learn all of the features of JavaScript, React, and TypeScript
  3. write lots of code:
    - I have to make software to gain skill
    - the program I make will not do much, and it will probably have messy code, but that doesn't matter
    - read some theory, get some advice, and make a new program
    - each program I make should be bigger and better than the last
    - Repeat these steps for long enough, and I will become an expert
  4. Seek for help:
    - it's OK to ask for help only if I do these:
      - always try to google my problem first
      - analyse the answer and learn the cause behind my error
        - with this way, when I encounter the same error again, I already know how to fix it
    - If I constantly hitting unsolvable problems, that probably means that my project is too ambitious
    - Scale it back, and make something smaller until my skills improve
  5. Seeking help the right way:
    - **paste in my exact error message**
      - this is the most important piece of information
    - if there is no error message, **explain what I expected to happen, and what actually happened**
      - something like "I expect it to output 5, but it actually outputs 7"
      - Often, the problem is not in my code, it is in my expectations
      - If I don't explain what I expected, I will get answers like "the code looks fine" and "what is the problem?"
    - **paste in my broken code**
      - It is very difficult to debug a problem without seeing the code
      - paste it all in, if it's not too big, because people will run my code to investigate the problem
      - If there is too much code, paste it into a Github Gist or Pastebin.com, then put the link into my question
    - **format my code correctly**
      - don't just paste in the code like normal text
      - master how to format the code nicely so it is easy to read

```python
# It should look like this:

def foobar
  puts 1 + 2 / 3
end
```

```python
# Not like this:

def foobar
puts 1+2/3
end
```

    - **mention what I have already tried**
      - this tells people that I have already put in some effort
    - **try to use correct terminology**
      - make an effort to learn the common terms, and use them correctly

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where I write down work that comes up:
For example: wife need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help
  - My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to my Outcome-Based Goals 
  ==> the work I planned to get done have top priorities

## Personal Notes

- **REMEMBER: I don't become a programmer from tutorial, reading codes or books. I become a programmer WHEN I AM DOING the coding (It doesn't matter how many line I write, How bad/good each block of code look like)**

**Day 66 (Wednesday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday I will be continue redoing tracker app, read on Unit Test, define programming terminology, and try to understand jargon in layman term. Try to master the workflow. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done.
This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal.
-->
<!-- My Foundation -->
- **Fundamental**
- [The five basic elements](https://study.com/academy/lesson/5-basic-elements-of-programming.html), in programming are:
  - **Input**: getting data and commands into the computer
  - **Output**: getting your results out of the computer
  - **Variables and Data Structures**: storing information, which may change over time
  - **Mathematical Operations (Arithmetic)**: performing mathematical calculations on my data
  - **Looping and Conditionals**: testing to see if a condition is true of false, and cycling through a set of instructions until some condition is met

- [Turning Problems into Code](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)
- **As much as 70% of my time should be spent in steps 1-3 & 10**
  - **10 steps guidelines which I can use for any [programming problem](https://codeburst.io/10-steps-to-solving-a-programming-problem-8a32d1e96d74):**
<!-- see day 20220604 notes -->
  1. Read the problem several times until I can explain it to someone else

  2. Solve the problem manually test it with 4 sets of sample data

  3. Optimize the manual steps, make it better

  4. Write the manual steps as pseudo-code or comments

  5. Replace the pseudo-code or comments into real code

  6. Simplify and optimize the real code
<!-- - _some questions I can ask myself:_
  - What are my goals for simplifying and optimizing?
  - Am I trying to condense the code as much as possible?
  - Is the goal to make the code more readable?
  - How else can I make the code more readable?
  - Are there any more extra steps I can take out?
  - Are there any variables or functions I ended up not even needing or using?
  - Am I repeating some steps a lot?
  - Can I define in another function?
  - Are there better ways to handle edge cases?
-->
  7. Debug
<!-- - _some techniques I can use:_
  - Check the console to see what the error message says
  - Comment out chunks or lines of code and output what I have so far to quickly see if the code is behaving how I expected
  - Use other sample data if there are scenarios I did not think of and see if the code will still work
  - Save different versions of my file if I am trying out a completely different approach -->
  8. Write some useful comments
<!-- 
  - Try to write brief, high-level comments that help me understand what's going on if it is not obvious
  - This comes in handy when I am working on more complex problems
  - It helps understand what a particular function is doing and why
  - Through the use of clear variable names, function names, and comments, I (or others) should be able to understand:
    - What is this code for?
    - What is it doing?
-->
  9. Get feedback through code reviews
  
  10. Practice, practice, practice

- Facing any complex challenge/problems, **writing actual code is only a small part of the process:**
  - I must divide the problem before any attempt to solve it
  - **Step1:** Understanding the problem: _Follow 10 step guidelines 10.1_
    - breaking large problem down into smaller parts/features
    - try to figure out what I have to do is to write it down, draw a diagram, or tell someone else or yellow duck about it
    - [During gathering requirements phase,](https://www.bridging-the-gap.com/what-questions-do-i-ask-during-requirements-elicitation/) ask questions:
    - **Always Ask "FIVE WHYs":**
      - Why a specific problem is occurring, or what I am trying to solve and note the main reason:
      - Qns 1: Why is this main reason exists?
      - Qns 2: Why on answer of Qns 1?
      - Qns 3: Why on answer of Qns 2?
      - Qns 4: Why on answer of Qns 3?
      - Qns 5: Why on answer of Qns 4?
      - Answer to question 5 should be the root cause I should address

  - **Step 2:** Planning the solution
    - Once I have the answers to my questions, try write out a _problem statement_ that explain exactly what I am doing
    - If I have a clear problem statement, look at the nouns and verbs in the statement.
    - **NOUNS** - will become my inputs and outputs
    - **VERBS** - will be my processes
<!-- - For example: Create a simple tip calculator:
  - The program should prompt for a bill amount and a tip rate.
  - The program must compute the tip and then display both the tip and the total amount of the bill.
- Look at the nouns. (make a list of it)
  - bill amount
  - tip rate
  - tip
  - total amount
- Look at the verbs. (make a list of it)
  - prompt
  - compute
  - display
-->
- **Problem statement questionnaires:**
  - What's the context?
  - When would this work?
  - Where would this work?
  - Who does this benefit?
  - How to solve the problem?
    1. What is the problem or what problem does it solve?
    2. What do I need to know to and use to build this application?
    3. What is the inputs?
    4. What is the processes?
    5. What is the outputs?
    6. What does the solution should look like? etc. etc.
  - Prioritize if there are multiple root causes by:
    1. urgency
    2. size of impact
    3. subsequent problems solved
    4. dependency
    5. ease of resolution

  - **Step 3:** Testing the program, _Follow guidelines 10.2_
    - Always think about the result I want to get right from the start using a process called _test-driven development (TDD)_
    - **KEY "TDD" CONCEPTS:** - is to think about the expected result of the program is ahead of time and then work toward getting there
    - by creating a test plans that lists the program's input and its expected result

  - **STep 4:** Writing the algorithm in pseudocode, _Follow guidelines 10.4_
    - Algorithm is a step by step set of operations that need to be performed
    - If I take an algorithm and write code to perform those operations, I end up with a computer program

  - **Step 5:** Writing the code, _Follow guidelines 10.5 onwards_

- [Computer Programming - Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_basics.htm)
- [Programming Terminology](https://careerkarma.com/blog/programming-terminology/)

- [Naming Conventions](https://unional.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/pages/default/draft/naming-conventions.html)
  - Single letter names
    - Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming.
  - Name casing
    - Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances. eslint: camelCase jscs: requireCamelCaseOrUpperCaseIdentifiers
    - Use PascalCase when naming constructors or classes. eslint: new-cap jscs: requireCapitalizedConstructors
    - Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function's name.
    - Use PascalCase when you export a singleton / function library / bare object.
  - Name prefixes
    - Use a leading underscore _ when naming private properties. eslint: no-underscore-dangle jscs: disallowDanglingUnderscores
  - this reference
    - Don't save references to this. Use arrow functions or Function#bind. jscs: disallowNodeTypes
  - File naming
    - If your file exports a single class, your filename should be exactly the name of the class.

  - Build _CRUD REST API_ with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL
  - I'll learn how to create a CRUD RESTful API in a Node.js environment that runs on an Express server and uses a PostgreSQL database
  - The goal is to allow CRUD operations, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, on the API, which will run the corresponding database commands
  - To do so, I'll set up a route for each endpoint and a function for each query

    - Representational State Transfer (REST) defines a set of standards for web services
    - An API is an interface that software programs use to communicate with each other
    - RESTful API is an API that conforms to the REST architectural style and constraints
    - REST systems are stateless, scalable, cacheable, and have a uniform interface

    - [What is the difference between CRUD and REST API?](https://hevodata.com/learn/crud-vs-rest/)
    - When building an API, I want the model to provide four basic functionalities
    - It should be able to create, read, update, and delete resources
    - This set of essential operations is commonly referred to as CRUD
      - RESTful APIs most commonly utilize HTTP requests
      - Four of the most common HTTP methods in a REST environment are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, which are the methods by which a developer can create a CRUD system

    - [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a fast, un-opinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
    - Although Express is minimalist, it is also very flexible, leading to the development of various Express middlewares that I can use to address almost any task or problem imaginable
  - [What is PostgreSQL?](https://www.postgresql.org)
    - [SQL Server vs PostgreSQL](https://www.educba.com/sql-server-vs-postgresql/)
    - PostgreSQL, commonly referred to as Postgres, is a free, open source relational database management system
    - PostgreSQL is a robust relational database
    - It is known for stability, extensibility, and standards compliance, it's a popular choice for developers and companies.

      - node-postgres, or pg, is a non-blocking PostgreSQL client for Node.js
      - It is a collection of Node.js modules for interfacing with a PostgreSQL database
      - Among the many features node-postgres supports include callbacks, promises, async/await, connection pooling, prepared statements, cursors, rich type parsing, and C/C++ bindings

## Today's Summary

I should now able to build a functioning API server that runs on Node.js and is hooked up to an active PostgreSQL database

Today I had learned how to install and set up PostgreSQL in the command line, create users, databases, and tables, and run SQL commands

At the same time also learned how to create an Express server that can handle multiple HTTP methods and use the pg module to connect to PostgreSQL from Node.js

I hope using this knowledge, I should be able to build on this API and utilize it for the upcoming project: SHARE App...

=============================================================================

- **Step 1: Creating a PostgreSQL database**
  - installing PostgreSQL, creating a new user, creating a database, and initializing a table with a schema and some data

```bash
# 1.1 install postgresql with brew
brew install postgresql

# 1.2 get postgresql up and running with services start
brew services start postgresql
==> Successfully started `postgresql` (label: homebrew.mxcl.postgresql)

# If at any point I want to stop the postgresql service, I can run brew services stop postgresql.

# 1.3 connect to the default postgres database with the default login information and no option flags:
psql postgres

# 1.4 # to denote that I have logged in as the superuser, or root:
>postgres=#

# Commands within psql start with a backslash \
# 1.5 \conninfo - can check what database, user, and port I've connected to
> postgres=# \conninfo
You are connected to database "postgres" as user "admin" via socket in "/tmp" at port "5432".

# Frequent used commands:
# \q: Exit psql connection
# \c: Connect to a new database
# \dt: List all tables
# \du: List all roles
# \list: List databases
```

- **Step 2: Creating a role in Postgres**
  - 2.1 Let's create a role called admin and give it a password of 12345. A role can function as a user or a group

```bash
# 2.1
postgres=# CREATE ROLE admin WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '12345';

# 2.2 I want admin to be able to create a database
postgres=# ALTER ROLE admin CREATEDB;

# 2.3 I can run \du to list all roles and users
 admin     | Create DB                                                  | {}
 javierho  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS | {}

# 2.4 I want to create a database from the admin user. Exit from the default session with \q for quit:
postgres=# \q

# 2.5 back in our computer's default terminal connection
# Let's connect postgres with admin
> psql -d postgres -U admin
psql (14.3)
Type "help" for help.

# Instead of postgres=#, our prompt now shows postgres=> , meaning no longer logged in as a superuser.
> postgres=>
```

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

=============================================================================

- **Step 3: Creating a database**

```bash
# 3.1 create a database with the SQL command
postgres=> CREATE DATABASE api;
CREATE DATABASE

# 3.2 Use the \list command to see the available databases
postgres=> \list
 api       | admin    | UTF8     | C       | C     | 
 postgres  | javierho | UTF8     | C       | C     | 
 template0 | javierho | UTF8     | C       | C     | =c/javierho          +
           |          |          |         |       | javierho=CTc/javierho
 template1 | javierho | UTF8     | C       | C     | =c/javierho          +
           |          |          |         |       | javierho=CTc/javierho

# 3.3 Let's connect to the new api database with admin using the \c connect command
postgres=> \c api
You are now connected to database "api" as user "admin".
api=>
# prompt now shows that we're connected to api
```

- **Step 4: Creating a table**
  - in the psql command prompt, let's create a table called users with three fields, two VARCHAR types, and an auto-incrementing PRIMARY KEY ID

```bash
# 4.1
api=> CREATE TABLE users (ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(30), email VARCHAR(30));
CREATE TABLE

# Make sure not to use the backtick ` character when creating and working with tables in PostgreSQL
# While backticks are allowed in MySQL, they're not valid in PostgreSQL
# Also ensure that you do not have a trailing comma in the CREATE TABLE command

# 4.2 Let's add some data to work with by adding two entries to users
api=> INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Tom', 'tom@example.com'), ('Jerry', 'jerry@example.com');
INSERT 0 2

# 4.3 Let's make sure that the information above was correctly added by getting all entries in users
api=> SELECT * FROM users;
 id | name  |       email       
----+-------+-------------------
  1 | Tom   | tom@example.com
  2 | Jerry | jerry@example.com
(2 rows)

# Now, I have a user, database, table, and some data
```

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

=============================================================================

- **Step 5: Setting up an Express server**
  - Let's build our Node.js RESTful API to connect to this data, stored in a PostgreSQL database

```bash
# To set up a Node.js app and Express server, first create a directory for the project to live in
#5.1 @filename: projectFolder/
mkdir node-api-postgres
cd node-api-postgres

# 5.2 run npm init -y to create a package.json file
npm init -y

# 5.3  install Express for the server and node-postgres to connect to PostgreSQL
npm install express pg --save

# Now, I have our dependencies loaded into node_modules and package.json
```

- 5.4 Let's create an index.js file, which we'll use as the entry point for our server

```bash
# 5.4.1 @filename: ./ProjectFolder/node-api-postgres/
touch index.js
```

```javascript
// 5.4.2 @filename: ./ProjectFolder/node-api-postgres/index.js
// At the top, I'll require the express module, the built-in body-parser middleware, and I'll set our app and port variables

const                   //variable keyword
 express                //variable name
  =                     //assignment operator
   require              // to use built-in module
   ('express')          // express module
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.use(bodyParser.json())
app.use(
  bodyParser.urlencoded({
    extended: true,
  })
)

// 5.5 tell a route to look for a GET request on the root / URL and return some JSON:
app.get('/', (request, response) => {
  response.json({ info: 'Node.js, Express, and Postgres API' })
})

// 5.6 set the app to listen on the port I set:
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App running on port ${port}.`)
})
```

```bash
# 5.7 From CLI, let's start the server by hitting index.js:
> node index.js
App running on port 4001.
```

- 5.8 let's key in <http://localhost:4001> in the URL bar of the browser, and it should show the JSON that set earlier
![browser screenshot 1](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/IMG/PNG/ss1.png)

- The Express server is running now, but only sending some static JSON data that we created
  - Next step is to connect to PostgreSQL from Node.js to be able to make dynamic queries
  - I can connect to a Postgres database using a **Client** like [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) or from **Node.js**

- **Step 6: Connecting to a Postgres database from Node.js**
  - Let's use the node-postgres module to create a pool of connections
  - Therefore, I don't have to open and close a client each time I make a query
  - A popular option for production pooling would be to use _pgBouncer_, a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL

- // 6.1 Let's create a file called queries.js and set up the configuration of your PostgreSQL connection:

```bash
# 6.1.1 @filename: ./ProjectFolder/node-api-postgres/
touch queries.js
```

```javascript
// 6.1.2 @filename: ./ProjectFolder/node-api-postgres/queries.js
const Pool = require('pg').Pool
const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'me',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'api',
  password: 'password',
  port: 5432,
})
```

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

=============================================================================

- **Step 7: Creating routes for CRUD operations**
  - Let's set up a route for each endpoint and a function corresponding to each query to allow CRUD operations, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE on the API, which will run the corresponding database commands
  - Let's create six functions for six routes, as shown below
    - First, create all the functions for each route
    - Then, export the functions so they're accessible:
      - 7.1 GET: / | displayHome()
      - 7.2 GET: /users | getUsers()
      - 7.3 GET: /users/:id | getUserById()
      - 7.4 POST: /users | createUser()
      - 7.5 PUT: /users/:id | updateUser()
      - 7.6 DELETE: /users/:id | deleteUser()
  - In index.js, I made an app.get() for the root endpoint with a function in it
  - Now, in queries.js, let's create endpoints that will display all users, display a single user, create a new user, update an existing user, and delete a user

```javascript
// @filename: ./ProjectFolder/node-api-postgres/queries.js

// GET: / | displayHome()
// 7.1 GET all users
// This first endpoint will be a GET request
// I can put the raw SQL that will touch the api database inside the pool.query()
// I'll SELECT all users and order by ID.

const                                     // variable keywords
getUsers                                  // variable whatever-I-name
 =                                        // assignment operator
  (request, response)                     // 2 arguments
    => {                                  // arrow function
  pool.query                              // query keyword
  ('SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id ASC', // SQL query syntax
     (error, results)                     // 2 arguments
      => {                                // arrow function
    if                                    // if statement
    (error)                               // if error
    {                                     // start curly brace
      throw error                         // throw keyword
    }                                     // end curly brace
    response.status                       // status keyword
    (200)                                 // status code
    .json(results.rows)                   // json keyword and send the results
    })
}

// 7.2 GET a single user by ID

// For our /users/:id request, I'll get the custom id parameter by the URL and use a WHERE clause to display the result

// In the SQL query, let's for id=$1
// In this instance, $1 is a numbered placeholder that PostgreSQL uses natively instead of the ? placeholder that is recognize from other variations of SQL

const getUserById = (request, response) => {
  const id = parseInt(request.params.id)

  pool.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [id], (error, results) => {
    if (error) {
      throw error
    }
    response.status(200).json(results.rows)
  })
}

// 7.3 POST a new user

// The API will take a GET and POST request to the /users endpoint

// In the POST request, let's add a new user
// In this function, let's extracting the name and email properties from the request body and inserting the values with INSERT

const createUser = (request, response) => {
  const { name, email } = request.body

  pool.query('INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ($1, $2) RETURNING *', [name, email], (error, results) => {
    if (error) {
      throw error
    }
    response.status(201).send(`User added with ID: ${results.rows[0].id}`)
  })
}

// 7.4 PUT updated data in an existing user

// The /users/:id endpoint will also take two HTTP requests, the GET I created for getUserById and a PUT to modify an existing user
// For this query, let's combine what is learned so far in GET and POST to use the UPDATE clause

// It's worth noting that PUT is idempotent, meaning the exact same call can be made over and over and will produce the same result. PUT is different than POST, in which the exact same call repeated will continuously make new users with the same data:

const updateUser = (request, response) => {
  const id = parseInt(request.params.id)
  const { name, email } = request.body

  pool.query(
    'UPDATE users SET name = $1, email = $2 WHERE id = $3',
    [name, email, id],
    (error, results) => {
      if (error) {
        throw error
      }
      response.status(200).send(`User modified with ID: ${id}`)
    }
  )
}

// 7.5 DELETE a user

// Lastly, let's use the DELETE clause on /users/:id to delete a specific user by ID
// This call is very similar to our getUserById() function:

const deleteUser = (request, response) => {
  const id = parseInt(request.params.id)

  pool.query('DELETE FROM users WHERE id = $1', [id], (error, results) => {
    if (error) {
      throw error
    }
    response.status(200).send(`User deleted with ID: ${id}`)
  })
}

// 7.6 Exporting CRUD functions in a REST API

// To access these functions from index.js, I'll need to export them
// Let's do so with module.exports, creating an object of functions
// Since using the ES6 syntax, we can write getUsers instead of getUsers:getUsers and so on:

module.exports = {
  getUsers,
  getUserById,
  createUser,
  updateUser,
  deleteUser,
}
```

- **Step 8: Setting up CRUD functions in a REST API**
  - Now that I have all of the queries, but need to pull them into the index.js file and make endpoint routes for all the query functions have created

```javascript
// @filename: ./ProjectFolder/node-api-postgres/index.js

// 8.1 To get all the exported functions from queries.js, I'll require the file and assign it to a variable:
const db = require('./queries')

// 8.2 for each endpoint, let's set the HTTP request method, the endpoint URL path, and the relevant function:
app.get('/users', db.getUsers)
app.get('/users/:id', db.getUserById)
app.post('/users', db.createUser)
app.put('/users/:id', db.updateUser)
app.delete('/users/:id', db.deleteUser)
```

- **Step 9: Start up server and test the POST, PUT, and DELETE requests**
  - With just these two files, I have a server, database, and our API all set up

```bash
# 9.1 Let's start up the server by hitting index.js again:
> node index.js
App running on port 4001.
```

- 9.2 go to <http://localhost:4001/users> or <http://localhost:4001/users/1>, I'll see the JSON response of the two GET requests
![browser screenshot 2](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/IMG/PNG/ss2.png)

- To test the POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, let's use a tool like Postman or a VS Code extension like Thunder Client to send the HTTP requests
- Using a Postman or Thunder Client tool makes it simple to query endpoints with different HTTP methods
  - Simply enter your URL, choose the specific HTTP method, insert JSON value if the endpoint is a PUT or POST route, and hit send:
- GET request
![browser screenshot 3](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/IMG/PNG/ss3.png)
- POST request
![browser screenshot 4](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/IMG/PNG/ss4.png)

- The example above shows sending a POST/GET request to the specified route
- The POST option suggests that it is a POST request
- The URL beside the method is the API endpoint, and the JSON content is the data to be sent to the endpoint
- I can hit the different routes similarly.. Let's have fun with the PUT and DELETE requests....

=============================================================================

- **Elements/Components/Instances/Props References**
  - **Create:** Use the HTTP POST method to create a resource in a REST environment
  - **Read:** Use the GET method to read a resource, retrieving data without altering it
  - **Update:** Use the PUT method to update a resource
  - **Delete:** Use the DELETE method to remove a resource from the system
  - **PostgreSQL command prompt**
    - _psql_ is the PostgreSQL interactive terminal
    - Running _psql_ will connect me to a PostgreSQL host
    - _psql --help_ will give me more information about the available options for connecting with _psql_
      - _-h: --host=HOSTNAME:_ The database server host or socket directory; the default is local socket
      - _-p: --port=PORT:_ The database server port; the default is 5432
      - _-U: --username=USERNAME:_ The database username; the default is your_username
      - _-w: --no-password:_ Never prompt for password
      - _-W: --password:_ Force password prompt, which should happen automatically

  - [API Best Practices](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev-guides/api-design/api-best-practices-series-intro/)
  - In a production environment, It would better to put the configuration details in a separate file with restrictive permissions so that it is not accessible from version control

  - ['body-parser'module](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-express-body-parser)
  - Express body-parser is an npm library used to process data sent through an HTTP request body
  - It exposes four express middlewares for parsing text, JSON, url-encoded and raw data set through an HTTP request body
  - These middlewares are functions that process incoming requests before they reach the target controller
  - [express()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)
    - Express provides methods to specify what function is called for a particular HTTP verb ( GET , POST , SET , etc.) and URL pattern ("Route"), and methods to specify what template ("view") engine is used, where template files are located, and what template to use to render a response
  - [const app = express()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27599614/var-express-requireexpress-var-app-express-what-is-express-is-it)

    - A new body object containing the parsed data is populated on the request object after the middleware (i.e. req.body)
    - _app.use(bodyParser.json())_ basically tells the system that I want json to be used
    - _bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: ...})_ basically tells the system whether I want to use a simple algorithm for shallow parsing (i.e. false) or complex algorithm for deep parsing that can deal with nested objects (i.e. true)

    - [Express' app.get()](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/express/app-get) function lets me define a route handler for GET requests to a given URL
  - [response.json([selector])](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/json)
    - The json() method of the [Response interface](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/k6-http/response/response-json/) takes a Response stream and reads it to completion
    - It returns a promise which resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON
  - [pgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org)
    - PgBouncer is an open-source, lightweight, single-binary connection pooler for PostgreSQL
    - It can pool connections to one or more databases (on possibly different servers) and serve clients over TCP and Unix domain sockets
    - PgBouncer maintains a pool of connections for each unique user, database pair
    - There are 3 reasons why it is be used:
      - It reduces PostgreSQL resource consumption (memory, backends, fork)
      - It supports online restart/upgrade without dropping client connections
      - It allows PostgreSQL restart/upgrade without dropping client connections
  - [(req, res) => {}](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-res-object-in-expressjs)
    - _res_ object in Express. Short for response, the res object is one half of the request and response cycle to send data from the server to the client-side through HTTP requests
      - used as callback **arguments**
      - _The res_ object can also specify HTTP status codes with the .status() method: **_res.status(404)**
      - The _res_ object holds methods to facilitate data and file transfer as part of your response cycle from your Express server to the client-side.
    - _req_ object in Express. Short for request, the req object is one half of the request and response cycle to examine calls from the client side, make HTTP requests, and handle incoming data whether in a string or JSON object
      - The _[req](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-req-object-in-expressjs)_ object as part of the request cycle to handle HTTP requests and data from the client side
  - [pool.query()](https://node-postgres.com/api/pool)
    - Often we only need to run a single query on the database, so as convenience the pool has a method to run a query on the first available idle client and return its result.
  - [(error, results) => {}](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-first-callback-in-node-js/)
    - Error-First Callback in Node.js is a function which either returns an error object or any successful data returned by the function
      - The first argument in the function is reserved for the error object
      - If any error has occurred during the execution of the function, it will be returned by the first argument
      - The second argument of the callback function is reserved for any successful data returned by the function
      - If no error occurred then the error object will be set to null
  - [if (error) { throw error } exception(error) handling control flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling#throw_statement)
    - [What is exception handling?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-exception-handling)
      - Exception handling is the process of responding to unwanted or unexpected events
    - [throw keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_throw.asp)
      - The throw statement allows you to create a custom error.
      - The throw statement throws (generates) an error.
        - The technical term for this is:
        - The throw statement throws an exception.
        - The exception can be a JavaScript String, a Number, a Boolean or an Object
  - **res.status(200).json(results.rows)**
    - integrate the .status() method on the res object and pass in an HTTP status code as an argument
    - [res.status(200) method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/status)
      - The status read-only property of the Response interface contains the HTTP status codes of the response
        - For example, 200 for success, 404 if the resource could not be found
    - [res.status(code_element)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)
      - HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed
      - The [Status-Code element](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_status_codes.htm#) in a server response, is a 3-digit integer where the first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response and the last two digits do not have any categorization role.
    - [res.json(results.rows) method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/json)
      - **json()**
        - The json() method of the Response interface takes a Response stream and reads it to completion
        - It returns a promise which resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON
      - JSON (Java Script Object Notation) is a lightweight text-based data format that helps to interchange data easily between modern applications
  - [How do I return JSON in HTTP response?](https://reqbin.com/req/gzezk8d5/json-response-example)
    - [.send(`User modified with ID: ${id})](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/express-js-res-send-function/)
      - The res.send() function basically sends the HTTP response
      - The body _(`User modified with ID: ${id})_ parameter can be a String or a Buffer object or an object or an Array
      - **Parameter:** This function accepts a single parameter body that describe the body which is to be sent in the response
  - [parseInt(req.params.id)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt)
    - The parseInt() function parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix (the base in mathematical numeral systems)
    - [(req.params.id) property](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/express-js-req-params-property/)
      - The req.params property is an object containing properties mapped to the named route "parameters"
        - For example, if I have the route /users/:id, then the "id" property is available as req.params.id
        - This object defaults to {}.
  - [idempotent](https://www.mscharhag.com/api-design/http-idempotent-safe)
  - Idempotence, in programming and mathematics, is a property of some operations such that no matter how many times you execute them, you achieve the same result
  - In programming, idempotence can be a property of many different code elements, including functions, methods, requests and statements

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection.
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority.

ASK Myself During This Time:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=> How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=> What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=> Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work.
This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review.

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month.
For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus"
