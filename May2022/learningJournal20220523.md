# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 21:
FIND LOST or MISPLACED ITEMS:
  You know all things; 
  You know where MY CAREER Path is, and you now reveal to me where it is.
  -->
The Law of Giving: **Give, thou shalt Receive** <br/>
Today, bring whomever I encounter a gift: a smile, a compliment or flower.<br/>
Gratefully receive gifts. Keep wealth circulating by giving and receiving care, affection, appreciation and love</br>

<!-- I will put the Law of Giving into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. Wherever I go, and whoever I encounter, I will bring them a gift. The gift maybe a compliment , a flower, or a prayer. Today, I will give something to everyone I come into contact with, and so I will begin the process of circulating joy, wealth, and affluence in my life and in the lives of others.
  2. Today I will gratefully receive all gifts that life has to offer me. I will receive the gifts of nature; sunlight and the sound of birds singing, or spring showers. I will also be open to receiving from others, whether it be in the form of a material gift, money, a compliment, or a prayer.
  3. I will make a commitment to keep wealth circulating in my life by giving and receiving life's most precious gifts: the gifts of caring, affection, appreciation, and love. Each time I meet someone, I will silently wish them happiness, joy, and laughter.-->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Don't Always Believe My Eyes<br/>
Non-players are masters at visual effects, to distract from their manipulations. <br/>
Guard myself by paying more attention to the content and the facts than the form of their message. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man always said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being" - Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful to:** have the opportunity to follow my dreams. <br/>

<!-- what has holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Core Traits of a **"SOCIALLY INTELLIGENT PERSON"**: <br/>
They speak with precision. <br/>
They say what they intend to say without skirting around the issue. They speak calmly, simply, concisely, and mindfully. <br/>
They focus on communicating something, not just receiving a response from others. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When would this work?
- Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [x] How much sleep am I getting every night and what am I doing to improve the quality of my sleep? <br/>
- [x] Do I enjoy learning? If so, what am I doing to ensure that I keep learning? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to my Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 50 (Monday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday will be learning advance state management with Recoil to manage global state management, work on a Udemy's Blog & Tracker App. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
- **Fundamental**
  - [The five basic elements](https://study.com/academy/lesson/5-basic-elements-of-programming.html), in programming are:
    - Input: getting data and commands into the computer
    - Output: getting your results out of the computer
    - Looping and conditionals: testing to see if a condition is true of false, and cycling through a set of instructions until some condition is met
    - Mathematical operations (arithmetic): Performing mathematical calculations on your data
    - Variables and data structures: storing information, which may change over time

  - [Computer Programming - Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_basics.htm)

  - [Naming Conventions](https://unional.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/pages/default/draft/naming-conventions.html)
    - Single letter names
      - Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming.
    - Name casing
      - Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances. eslint: camelCase jscs: requireCamelCaseOrUpperCaseIdentifiers
      - Use PascalCase when naming constructors or classes. eslint: new-cap jscs: requireCapitalizedConstructors
      - Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function's name.
      - Use PascalCase when you export a singleton / function library / bare object.
    - Name prefixes
      - Use a leading underscore _ when naming private properties. eslint: no-underscore-dangle jscs: disallowDanglingUnderscores
    - this reference
      - Don't save references to this. Use arrow functions or Function#bind. jscs: disallowNodeTypes
    - File naming
      - If your file exports a single class, your filename should be exactly the name of the class.

- **What am I Learning/Working on now?**

Today, spent fairly good amount of time to completely dissect upcoming SHARE App code structure, a wise man once said, to overcome overwhelmed feeling and turn it into something productive is start very small.
So I start to break the project up into tiny bite size, spending whole day to look through the entire project inside out, and chopping all jargon into pieces by pieces and take them apart and spend time to look into it during my information & gathering phase.
Below are some breakdown of my works:

- **TOPIC**
  - Dissecting Project Structure Part I

## ACTIVATE_HTX SHARE APP

- **CONCEPTS: Nx workspace.json**
What is _workspace.json_?
  - Configuring the Workspace - [workspace.json](https://bit.dev/docs/workspace/workspace-json)
    - The workspace.json serves as the main configuration file for the workspace and its components.
    - is composed of a list of Aspects, and their corresponding configurations.

- **CONCEPTS: node modules packages**
- What is the purpose of _package.json_ & _package-lock.json_?

  - [package.json](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-package-json-guide)
  - [package.json vs package-lock.json - Differences, Purposes, Relevance](https://dillionmegida.com/p/package-vs-package-lock-json/)
    - package.json is a file usually found in packages
    - It contains meta-information about the package like versioning information, what the package is about, dependencies of the package, how to set up the package and so much more
    - The package.json file acts like a manifest for Ir application
    - The strength is in managing dependencies (prod, dev, peer, optional or bundled)
    - package.json holds important information of Ir package
  
  - [package-lock.json](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-package-lock-json-file)
  - [What Does package-lock.json Do?](https://medium.com/frontend-canteen/what-does-package-lock-json-do-explained-with-diagrams-89c2843ccbe8)
  - [Everything I Wanted To Know About package-lock.json](https://medium.com/coinmonks/everything-I-wanted-to-know-about-package-lock-json-b81911aa8ab8)
  - After doing **npm init**, a **_package.json_** file is created. But when I install a package, I'd notice the package-lock.json file (usually very long) automatically created.
    - similar to _package.json_
      - holding some information about my file, but there's more to it.
      - Remember the caret symbol in _package.json_ dependencies?
        - I could manually remove that symbol when I install a dependency, but that would be stressful.
      - With _package-lock.json_, the versions of all dependencies my package would need are locked (-lock).
      - This means when I run _npm install_ on another system, npm checks this file to install the exact versions of the dependencies.
      - If this file is absent, npm would then work with the caret symbol
    - This means that I should also commit package-lock.json to my source control
    - The major benefit of this file is that when my package is working perfectly (with all the dependencies used) on my system, I am sure that any attempt to install the package on another system would work exactly
    - It ensures similar dependencies in various environments where the package is being worked on
  - Why is this file longer?
    - It doesn't only lock the version of the packages in the _package.json_
    - It locks all versions of the dependencies and sub dependencies (and sub, sub, sub) that my package would need
    - While _package-json_ shows me **express**, _package-lock.json_ would show me a **dependency of express**

- **package.json & package-lock.json JARGON in laymen terms with references:**
  - [name]
    - This is the name for the project and is optional if the project is private
    - When a npm package is published, the name will be used as an URl
    - Hence, when the package gets published the name is required and must be unique on the npm repository
    - It has requirements to be URL-safe. It should be:
      - less than 214 characters
      - should not include spaces
      - can only contain lowercase letters, hyphens (-) or underscores (_)
      - The name can be prefixed with a scope (i.e.: @angular/angular-cli)
    - A good value if I have publicly published this package on Github is the repository name

  - [version]
    - A version number that should be understandable by node-semver
    - The version property is optional for private and required for public modules

  - [license]
    - Indicates the license of the package and expects a license name using its SPDX identifier
    - It defaults to the ISC license, and MIT would be another popular license choice
    - I can also use UNLICENSED for projects that are private and closed-source

  - [scripts]
    - The scripts key expects an object with script names as keys and commands as values, so it basically defines a set of node scripts I can execute
    - These scripts are command line applications
    - I can run them by calling npm run COMMAND or yarn COMMAND.
    - There are no limitations in the command name and scripts can do things like starting my project on a local server, building for production or running my tests
  - Typically, in the scripts commands I'll make the most manual changes in my package.json file

  - [private]
    - if set to true prevents the app/package to be accidentally published on npm

  - [devDependencies]
    - The devDependencies property is almost identical to the dependencies property, when it comes to structure
    - There is one key difference
      - The **dependencies** property is used to define the dependencies that a module needs to run in **production**
      - The **_devDependencies_** property is used to define the dependencies the module needs to run in **_development_**
  - When I install a package using npm or yarn,
    - npm install --dev <PACKAGENAME> or yarn add --dev <PACKAGENAME>
      - that package is automatically inserted in **devDependencies** list
  - **OR** I also can install a package with npm like this:
    - npm install --save-dev <package-name>
    - npm install --save-dev <package-name1> <package-name2>
    - npm install --save-dev <package-name>@version
    - npm i -D <package-name>
    - The package would be saved in package.json's devDependencies object with a value of caret symbol '^'

  - [dependencies]
    - The **dependencies** property is where dependencies, the other modules that this module uses, are defined
    - It takes an object that has the name and version at which each dependency should be used
    - I'll frequently find caret symbol (^) used in front of the dependencies' version numbers
      - This symbol signifies to npm that higher major versions of this package can be installed
    - And tildes symbol (~) included with package versions, these are the notation for version range.
  - When I install a package using npm or yarn,
    - npm install <PACKAGENAME> or yarn add <PACKAGENAME>
      - that package is automatically inserted in **dependencies** list
  - **OR** I also can install a package with npm like this:
    - npm install --save <package-name>
    - npm install --save <package-name1> <package-name2>
    - npm install --save <package-name>@version
    - npm i -s <package-name>
  - The package would be saved in package.json's dependencies object with a value of caret symbol '^'
    - Let's say I pushed my project to a repository and cloned it on another system
    - When I run **npm install** on that other system, with the symbol there, npm would check if there is a higher major version, and if there is, that version is installed.
      - This feature comes with a good and a bad side effect
        - GOOD: always get to use the latest versions of packages
        - BAD:  latest versions may contain bugs or may contain incompatible codes for Ir codebase

- [Npm List](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/nodejs-tutorial/npm-list/)
  - to show the installed packages in the current project as a dependency tree
  - npm ls -gp --depth=0
    - Listing global packages as a tree with a specified depth
  - npm list --global
    - to list the global packages.
  - npm list --json
    - to format the installed packages in the JSON format

### Software Installed

- **list of dependencies installed**
  - _GLOBAL_
  - Install globally
    - npm install --global <package-name>
    - npm install --g <package-name>
  - **OR**
    - npm i -g <package-name>
- I might need SU access on macos/linux to install globally
- [npm install -g nx](https://nx.dev/getting-started/nx-setup)

```bash
npm ls -gp --depth=0

- **nx.json JARGON in laymen terms with references:**
  - [extends]
    - The value of extends is a string which contains a path to another configuration file to inherit from
    - The configuration from the base file are loaded first, then overridden by those in the inheriting config file
    - All relative paths found in the configuration file will be resolved relative to the configuration file they originated in
  - [npmScope]
    - Tells Nx what prefix to use when generating library imports.
  - [affected]
    - Tells Nx which branch and HEAD to use when calculating affected projects.
      - **defaultBase** defines the default base branch, defaulted to **main**
  - [cli]
    - The following command generates a new library: nx g @nrwl/react-native:lib mylib
    - After setting the **defaultCollection** property, the lib is generated without mentioning the collection name: nx g lib mylib
  - [tasksRunnerOptions]
    - A task is an invocation of a target.
    - Tasks runners are invoked when I run nx test, nx build, nx run-many, nx affected, and so on
    - The tasks runner named "default" is used by default.
    - Tasks runners can accept different options.
      - **cacheableOperations** are the options supported by "nx/tasks-runners/default" 
      - **cacheableOperations** defines the list of targets/operations that are cached by Nx.
  - [defaultProject]
    - name of project
  - [generators]
    - Default generator options are configured in nx.json
  - [pluginsConfig]

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Try to code with lesser research and reference, embrace learning through failures, next 4 week to train myself yellow duck methods.
- Code with think aloud methods.
- Time Management
  - Where is the balance between learn, work, life and rest.
- Slow typing speed
  - How to speed up typing speed?
- Reading speed
  - Comprehended the logic but not the code.
- Memory skills
  - What causing me to lose my memory?
- "Make it Better" <== my personal workflow
  - learn to throw away code and start over again will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub.
- Logic & analytical thinking:
  - I should find a way to think in logical frames to solve problems.
  - important to have strong logical and analytical thinking  capabilities to decide which language or piece of code best suited for each user story.
- Detail-oriented:
  - how to ensure the precise accuracy in writing pieces of code?
  - important to have strong attention to detail to protect my work, remain efficient and prevent bugs.
- Creativity:
  - learn to recognize the potential for technological solutions to everyday problems.
  - important to understand how React Native + TypeScript works, the more creative ways to solve potential problems.
- Resourcefulness + independence:
  - able to complete individual tasks and later combine them together with other.
  - important to remain resourceful and to habe confidence in my own ability to find a solution to any coding problem that might arise.
- Curiosity:
  - important to remain curious about coding and various languages and technologies.
- Time-boxing to strict 90 minutes per task with a 20min rest break.

- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.

- Required improvement on technical writing of learning experience and daily lesson task reviews with a better layout.

- Read 1 chapter / 30min of Computational Thinking.

- add one more column for non-technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- try to practice these 9 principles for 52 weeks:
  1. Understand the Basics;
  2. Write Easy To Understand And Logical Programming Codes
  3. Try Analyzing my Code
  4. Read As Many Books I Can
  5. Talking to a fellow programmer
  6. Help others In Solving Their Problems
  7. Contribution to Open Source and Signing-up mailing lists
  8. Practice It Many Times As Possible
  9. Participate In Different Events

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

## MY GOAL for May

### Aim to create a personal work flow of writing code from scratch to practice and improve my skills

==============================================================================

#### Possible Project Work

**I wished to:** <br/>

1. Create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket
5. A food & nutrition app that provide food portions in smaller sizes to stimulate reduction of food consumption and reduction of food waste
6. A wellness app that provides more scientifically proven and generally understood advices to a health diet
7. An app to provide a more balanced healthcare for the various developed nations
8. An wellness and diet advisor app based on blood test result.
