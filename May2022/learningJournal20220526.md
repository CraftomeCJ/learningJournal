# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 21:
FIND LOST or MISPLACED ITEMS:
  You know all things; 
  You know where MY CAREER Path is, and you now reveal to me where it is. 
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Intention and Desire: **"Make a list of desires"**<br/>
Inherent in every intention and desire is the mechanics for its fulfillment. <br/>
Trust that when things don't seem to go my way, there is a reason. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Intention and Desire into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. I will make a list of all my desires. I will carry this list with me whenever I go. I will look at it before I go to sleep at night. I will look at it when I wake up in the morning. 
  2. I will release this list of my desires and surrender it to the womb of creation, trusting that when things don't seem to go my way, there is a reason, and that the cosmic plan has designs for me much grander than even those I have conceived.
  3. I will remind myself to practice present-moment awareness in all my actions. I will refuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate the quality of the attention in the present moment. I will accept the present as it is, and manifest the future through my deepest, most cherished intentions and desires.-->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
The Sincerity Ploy<br/>
By pretending to bare their heart to me, clever non-players know they make it more likely that I will reveal my own secrets. <br/>
They give me a false confession in hopes that I will give them a real one. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man always said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"No matter how hard the past, you can always begin again." - Jack Kornfield <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful to:** know what pain feels like to tell me that I've felt happiness before. <br/>

<!-- what has holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Core Traits of a **"SOCIALLY INTELLIGENT PERSON"**: <br/>
They validate other people's feelings. <br/>
To validate someone's else feelings is to accept that they feel the way they do without trying to use logic to dismiss or deny or change their minds. <br/> (For example: "I am sad today." "Well, you shouldn't be, your life is great!!") The main misunderstanding here is that validating feelings is not the same thing as validating ideas. <br/>There are many ideas that do not need or deserve to be validated, but everyone's feelings deserve to be seen and acknowledged and respected. <br/>Validating someone's emotions is validating who they really are, even if you would respond differently. So in other words, it is validating who someone is, even if they are different than you. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When would this work?
- Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [x] Don't spend much time thinking about what other people think. <br/>Think about what I think. Think instead: about the results, about the impact, about whether it is the right thing to do. <br/>
- [x] Do I believe I have control over how I feel and the experiences I have in life? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

    2. easier to document?
    3. more reusable?
    4. more reliable? -->
<!-- learn write it THREE times
  - First time ==> write the software to prove myself that the solution is possible;
  - Second time ==> make it work
  - Third time ==> make it work right
  - throw away code and start over will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub. -->
<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 53 (Thursday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday will be learning and researching upcoming project tech stack. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

I think I found out why I have difficulties getting beyond the basics, that makes the quote resonate...
**"The Cliff of Confusion - is the painful realization that it's a lot harder when the hand-holding ends and it feels like I can't actually do anything on my own yet. My primary challenges are constant debugging and not quite knowing how to ask the right questions as I fight my way towards any kind of momentum."**

I feel that I already know the basics but why I can't write a program without guidance, with God's help, I realize that I probably don't understand the basics yet. how ironic!!! hahaha

Since I started this journey last year, I had been learning in the artificial environment that online courses and bootcamp classes provide to students.
Although they allow me to gain programming experience without the pain of setting up my own environment.
Unfortunately, that pain has not been avoided, it has just been delayed until the course is over.

Well, not too bad only took me 53 days of internship to realize that.. hahaha, a common pitfall for beginner like me I think..

- Let's hope these strategies can help me to push through this phase:
  - I will continue to make programs from scratch
    - start writing my own code, without instruction
    - start with an empty file, and type every line of code myself
    - look at other people's code
    - Analyse other people's code
    - learn a little bit about how it works, then write it myself
  - I will start small, very small
    - make something that would be useful in real life
    - start with load of make text-based games, time tracker, to-do list, or something to automate calculations
    - use these projects to learn all of the features of JavaScript, React, and TypeScript
  - write lots of code
    - I have to make software to gain skill
    - The program I make will not do much, and it will probably have messy code, but that doesn't matter
    - read some theory, get some advice, and make a new program
    - each program I make should be bigger and better than the last
    - Repeat these steps for long enough, and I will become an expert
  - ask for help
    - it's OK to ask for help only if I do these:
      - always try to google my problem first
      - analyse the answer and learn the cause behind my error
      - this way, when I encounter the same error again, I will already know how to fix it
    - If I constantly hitting unsolvable problems, that probably means that my project is too ambitious
    - Scale it back, and make something smaller until my skills improve
  - asking help the right way
    - **paste in my exact error message**
      - this is the most important piece of information
    - if there is no error message, **explain what I expected to happen, and what actually happened**
      - something like "I expect it to output 5, but it actually outputs 7"
      - Often, the problem isn't in my code, it's in my expectations
      - If I don't explain what I expected, I will get answers like "the code looks fine" and "what is the problem?"
    - **paste in my broken code**
      - It's very difficult to debug a problem without seeing the code
      - paste it all in, if it's not too big, because people will run my code to investigate the problem
      - If there is too much code, paste it into a Github Gist or Pastebin.com, then put the link into my question
    - **format my code correctly**
      - don't just paste in my code like normal text
      - learn how to format my code nicely so it is easy to read

```python
# It should look like this:

def foobar
  puts 1 + 2 / 3
end
```

```python
# Not like this:

def foobar
puts 1+2/3
end
```

- **mention what I have already tried**
  - this tells people that I've already put in some effort.

- **try to use correct terminology**
  - make an effort to learn the common terms, and use them correctly.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
- Why do I paste fundamental list daily???

  - It is to constant reminding myself to look at the fundamental of programming until the concepts is at my fingertips, completely inside out..and the rest shall follow

- **Fundamental**
  - [The five basic elements](https://study.com/academy/lesson/5-basic-elements-of-programming.html), in programming are:
    - Input: getting data and commands into the computer
    - Output: getting your results out of the computer
    - Looping and conditionals: testing to see if a condition is true of false, and cycling through a set of instructions until some condition is met
    - Mathematical operations (arithmetic): Performing mathematical calculations on your data
    - Variables and data structures: storing information, which may change over time

  - [Computer Programming - Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_basics.htm)

  - [Naming Conventions](https://unional.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/pages/default/draft/naming-conventions.html)
    - Single letter names
      - Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming.
    - Name casing
      - Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances. eslint: camelCase jscs: requireCamelCaseOrUpperCaseIdentifiers
      - Use PascalCase when naming constructors or classes. eslint: new-cap jscs: requireCapitalizedConstructors
      - Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function's name.
      - Use PascalCase when you export a singleton / function library / bare object.
    - Name prefixes
      - Use a leading underscore _ when naming private properties. eslint: no-underscore-dangle jscs: disallowDanglingUnderscores
    - this reference
      - Don't save references to this. Use arrow functions or Function#bind. jscs: disallowNodeTypes
    - File naming
      - If your file exports a single class, your filename should be exactly the name of the class.

## Exercise of the Day

Functional Programming with TypeScript **_Revisited_ Day 2**

[x] **Challenge:** Read ==> Function Programming with TypeScript (aim to understand the main characteristic of functional programming)

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

==============================================================================

## So do I know now?

- **CONCEPTS: [Stateless vs Stateful](https://dev.to/ananyaneogi/demystifying-modern-frontend-jargon-1agf)**
  - **Stateful**
    - programs or components store data in memory about the current state
    - They can modify the state and access its history as well.

  - **Stateless**
    - programs or components depend only on their arguments and do not access or even need knowledge about anything outside their scope
    - They do not reference any information from earlier in their execution
    - Pure functions are stateless
    - Its the statelessness that enables _referential transparency_ in pure functions.
    - When a piece of code outcomes are not influenced by previous events, it is called **stateless**

```typescript
// for this example: the result of the isIndexPage function will not be influenced by the number of times that we invoke it
let result = isIndexPage("/");

let result = true;

// then how are stateful code lei???
```

- Stateful code is very difficult to test and becomes a problem when I am trying to implement scalable and resilient systems.
- resilient system are systems that handle server failures;
- usually more than one server, so if one of them crashes, others can continue handling traffic
- new instances are created automatically after one of them crashed;
- this become difficult if one of the servers are stateful, because we have to safe everything before a crash and restore the state before we spin a new server
- But the whole process will be easier if we design our servers to be stateless

- **CONCEPTS: Declarative vs Imperative Programming**
  - Declarative code is one of FP main benefits
  - JavaScript can support both programming paradigms
  - **Declarative code:**
    - tells the computer what you want to achieve rather than how,
    - and the computer takes care of how to achieve the end result, such as Array.map
    - expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow
    - attempt to minimize or eliminate side-effects by describing what the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain, instead of describing how to accomplish it as a sequence of steps

  - **Imperative code**
    - gives instructions informing the computer how to achieve a desired result, such as for loop
    - use statements that change a program's state
    - consists of commands for the computer to perform
    - focuses on describing how a program operates

```TypeScript
// let's do an example to understand the concept:

// let's say I want to calculates the average result of an exam given a collection of objects that contains an ID 
// and a result for a list of students

interface Result {
  id: number;
  result: number;
}

const results: Result[] = [
  { id: 1, result: 64 },
  { id: 2, result: 87 },
  { id: 3, result: 89 },
];

// A function using 'for' loop statement assign 'avg()' function name passing in argument 'arr' annotated to Array[]
function avg(arr: Result[]) {

  let total = 0;                          // default value

  for (                                   // for loop syntax with 3 optional expressions separated by semi-colon ( ; )
     var i = 0;                           // initialization to init a loop count value
      i < arr.length;                     // termination condition, if true loop body execute
       i++)                               // step, an expression to update the loop counter
       {                                  // statement
    total += arr[i].result;               // do something here
  }
  return total / arr.length;
}

const resultsAvg = avg(results);
console.log(resultsAvg);

// Hope I can understand this is an imperative programming style ya.. 
// because it is using a control flow statements (for loop)
// why am I so sure is an imperative style??
// because it also changes the 'state'
// the 'total' variable is declared using the 'let' keyword
// so it has mutated as many times as results are contained in the 'results[]' array
```

```typescript
// let's have anther example:
// This time no control flow statements and no state mutations

interface                   // TYPE keyword to describe a type
 Result                     // unique whatever-I-name-it to define the TYPE name
  {                         // define the shape of objects and warp the TYPE object inside the curly braces {} object literal syntax.
  id: number;               // unique whatever-I-name-it object name with TYPE annotation close with a semi-colon
  result: number;
   }

// assign label 'results' to const variable wrapping an array of objects
const                       // variable KEYWORD string an array of object
results                     // unique whatever-I-name-it variable name
  : Result[]                // To declare an array that holds values of a specific type from interface with unique whatever-I-name-it to define the TYPE name
= [                         // array syntax to wrap array of values
  {                         // {} object literal syntax to wrap a pair of key: value object
    id: 1,                  // object 'id' key assigned with Type-safe value
    result: 64              // if value change to string I will get an error
  },
  { id: 2, result: 87 },
  { id: 3, result: 89 }

//Let's do another example:
//like the 'avg' function can calculate an average, but it doesn't need to be an average of result
const add = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
const div = (a: number, b: number) => a / b;
const avg = (arr: number[]) => div(addMany(...arr), arr.length);
const addMany = (...args: number[]) => args.reduce(add, 0);
const mapProp = <T>(k: keyof T, arr: T[]) => arr.map(a => a[k]);

interface Result {
  id: number;
  result: number;
}

const results = Result[] = [
  { id: 1, result: 640},
  { id: 2, result: 870},
  { id: 3, result: 870},
];

const resultsAvg = avg(mapProp('result', results));
console.log(resultsAvg);
```

```typescript
// The actual code to the problem that we are trying to solve is very small:

const resultsArg = avg(mapProp("result", results));

// even though this code is not reusable, but the add(), addMany(), div(), mapProp() and avg() function are reusable

//This demonstrates how declarative programming style can lead to more reusable code than imperative style.

- **JARGON in laymen terms:**
  - [pure function](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-a-pure-function-in-javascript)
    - An expression that is not referentially transparent is known as referentially opaque.
    - A pure function is a deterministic function
    - This means when a same input is passed every time, the function will return same output
    - In mathematical terms it is nothing but a well defined function.
    - A pure function will have the following properties:
      - It depends only on its own arguments.
      - It wont try to change variables out of its scope.
      - It doesn't produce any side effects.
  - A **pure function** is a referentially transparent expression.
  - [referentially transparent expression & referentially opaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency)
    - In computer science, referential transparency and referential opacity are properties of parts of computer programs
    - An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value (and vice-versa) without changing the program's behavior
    - This requires that the expression be pure - its value must be the same for the same inputs and its evaluation must have no side effects
    - An expression that is not referentially transparent is called referentially opaque.

  - [stateless](https://ultimatecourses.com/blog/stateful-stateless-components#stateless)
    - Pure function and referentially transparent expressions are stateless
    - When something is "stateless", it calculates its internal state but it never directly mutates it
    - This allows for complete referential transparency meaning that given the same inputs, it will always produce the same output
    - These are not essentially "living" as they are merely passed information
    - This means it has no knowledge of the past, current or future state changes
  - [stateful](https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/stateful-vs-stateless/)
    - When something is "stateful", it is a central point that stores information in memory about the app/component's state
    - It also has the ability to change it
    - It is essentially a "living" thing that has knowledge of past, current and potential future state changes.
  - ['for' loop statement](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/typescript/typescript_for_loop.htm)
    - control flow statement
    - The _for_ loop executes the code block for a specified number of times
    - It can be used to iterate over a fixed set of values, such as an array.
    - In practice, I should use a for loop if you know how many times the loop should run
    - If I want to stop the loop based on a condition other than the number of times the loop executes, I should use a while loop.
    - rarely used in practice because it makes the code more difficult to read and maintain.
  - [array of object](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/typescript/array-of-objects-in-typescript/)
  - lets me store multiple values in a single variable at once
  - Array of Objects is used to store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type
  - TypeScript Arrays are themselves a data type just as a string, Boolean, and number
  - I can define an array of objects by placing brackets after the interface
  - It can be named interface or an inline interface
  - **Rules and Regulations for Implementing**
    - Array of Objects, most part of it can be used interchangeably
    - Inline Types can be used in aliasing much more complicated types
    - Interfaces are much inclined to basic type structure such as an object or a class, etc
    - I cannot use keyword implements on an inline type of union between the multiple types as the class does not know which are the methods or values to be implemented
    - In the same context, I cannot declare an interface extending a union type
    - As a prototype of an interface needs to be specified on a declaration and not at the time of usage.
    - can merge declarations of an interface which have the same name.
    - Interfaces have the advantage of merging multiple declarations with the same name but are a bit less flexible with union types or advanced inline types.
    - By default, Inline Type declaration of Array of Objects is used in TypeScript

    - [JavaScript Map Object](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/javascript-map/)
  - [.reduce()](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/typescript/typescript_array_reduce.htm)
    - reduce() method applies a function simultaneously against two values of the array (from left-to-right) as to reduce it to a single value
    - Reduction operations are one of the most powerful operations in functional programming, and typically involve reducing a vector to a scalar (a list of values, to a single one)
    - This can be summing all values in an array, finding the average, minimum or maximum, or in any other way reducing a longer set of data to a smaller one, stemming from the original
  - [Rest parameters and spread syntax ...](https://javascript.info/rest-parameters-spread)
    - **...args** args is the name for the array
      - The rest of the parameters can be included in the function definition by using three dots ... followed by the name of the array that will contain them
      - The dots literally mean "gather the remaining parameters into an array"
  - [Generic Types < T >](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html)
    - typescripts Generics declaration
    - T (which does not have to be T. I could call it G.) is called a generic template where actual type of the T is replaced at runtime
    - **Why use generics?**
      - JS has arrays, but when I retrieve a value from the array, it literally could be anything (typescript: any). With TS I get Type safety by declaring them like:

```typescript
 // Array<T>
 let list: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
 // or 
 let list: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];
```

- [type operator keyof](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/keyof-types.html)
  - The keyof operator takes an object type and produces a string or numeric literal union of its keys
  - in another word, the keyof type operator takes an object type and creates a union type of its keys
    - **Rules and Regulations for keyof**
      - The keyof operator who used for to identify the elements with the help of key indexes
      - By using the Objects.keys() method, we can able to retrieve the key indexes and their values
      - For the above 2 steps, I can easily retrieve the data when I work on the bi-enterprise applications
  - [How to Use the `keyof` Type Operator in TypeScript](https://blog.devgenius.io/how-to-use-the-keyof-type-operator-in-typescript-6d5e0ea6740f?gi=19846f2fc582)
  - [Create an Array with the Keys of an Interface](https://dev.to/saulodias/create-an-array-with-the-keys-of-an-interface-2mod)
- [Type Operator typeof](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/typeof-types.html)
  - In TS typeof operator I can use in a type context to refer to the type of a variable or property
  - Not very useful for basic types, but combined with other type operators, I can use typeof to conveniently express many patterns
  - [Using a `typeof` type guard](https://learntypescript.dev/07/l3-typeof-type-guard)
    - TypeScript can narrow the type of a variable following an if statement that uses a typeof check. This approach is useful when checking against primitive types
  
- To understand the **_keyof_**, **_typeof_** usage in TS, first I need to understand what are _literal types_ and _union of literal types_
  - **Literal types**
    - Literal types in TS are more specific types of string, number or boolean
    - For example, "Hello World" is a string, but a string is not "Hello World"
    - "Hello World" is a more specific type of type string, so it is a literal type

```typescript
// A literal type can be declared as following:

type Greeting = "Hello"

//This means that the object of type Greeting can have only a string value "Hello" 

//and no other string value or any other value of any other type as shown in the following code:

let greeting: Greeting
greeting = "Hello" // OK
greeting = "Hi"    // Error: Type '"Hi"' is not assignable to type '"Hello"'

//Literal types are not useful on their own, however when combined with union types, type aliases and type guards they become powerful

//This is an example of union of literal types:

type Greeting = "Hello" | "Hi" | "Welcome"

//Now the object of type Greeting can have the value either "Hello", "Hi" or "Welcome".

let greeting: Greeting
greeting = "Hello"       // OK
greeting = "Hi"          // OK
greeting = "Welcome"     // OK
greeting = "GoodEvening" // Error: Type '"GoodEvening"' is not assignable to type 'Greeting'
```

- **keyof only**
  - keyof of some type T gives me a new type that is a union of literal types and these literal types are the names of the properties of T
  - The resulting type is a subtype of string.

```typescript
//For example, consider the following interface:

interface Person {
    name: string
    age: number
    location: string
}

//Using the keyof operator on the type Person will give me a new type as shown in the following code:

type SomeNewType = keyof Person

//This SomeNewType is a union of literal types ("name" | "age" | "location") that is made from the properties of type Person.

//Now I can create objects of type SomeNewType:

let newTypeObject: SomeNewType
newTypeObject = "name"           // OK
newTypeObject = "age"            // OK
newTypeObject = "location"       // OK
newTypeObject = "anyOtherValue"  // Error...
```

- **keyof typeof together on an object**
  - As I might already know, the typeof operator gives me the type of an object
  - In the above example of Person interface, I already knew the type, so I just had to use the keyof operator on type Person

```typescript
//But what to do when I don't know the type of an object or I just have a value and not a type of that value like the following?

const bmw = { name: "BMW", power: "1000hp" }

//This is where we use keyof typeof together.

//The typeof bmw gives me the type: { name: string, power: string }

//And then keyof operator gives me the literal type union as shown in the following code:

type CarLiteralType = keyof typeof bmw

let carPropertyLiteral: CarLiteralType
carPropertyLiteral = "name"       // OK
carPropertyLiteral = "power"      // OK
carPropertyLiteral = "anyOther"   // Error...
```

- **keyof typeof on an enum**
- In TS, enums are used as types at compile-time to achieve type-safety for the constants but they are treated as objects at runtime
- This is because, they are converted to plain objects once the TS code is compiled to JavaScript
- So, the explanation of the objects above is applicable here too

```typescript
//The example I would expect typeof ColorsEnum to return something like "Object" and then keyof "Object" to not do anything interesting:

enum ColorsEnum {
    white = '#ffffff',
    black = '#000000',
}

//Here ColorsEnum exists as an object at runtime, not as a type
//So, I need to invoke keyof typeof operators together as shown in the following code:

type Colors = keyof typeof ColorsEnum

let colorLiteral: Colors
colorLiteral = "white"  // OK
colorLiteral = "black"  // OK
colorLiteral = "red"    // Error...
```

```javascript
// this purpose of this function is to: 
//Sum up the results in the array and divide the total number of the array = average of number of results with .map() method to create a new array, then use .reduce() method to reduce two values into a single valuse and using .length property to return the array length..
const avg = ( arr: Result[] ) => division(arr.map(a => a.result).reduce(add, 0),arr.length)
```
