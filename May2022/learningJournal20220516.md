# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?

<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture.
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life.
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 20:
SOLVE A PROBLEM:
  My subconscious knows the answer.
  It is responding to me now.
  I give thanks because I know the infinite spirit of my subconscious knows all the things and is revealing the perfect answer to me.
  My real conviction is now setting free the majestic and glory of my subconscious mind.
  I rejoice that it is so.
  -->

The Law of Giving: **Give, thou shalt Receive** <br/>
Today, bring whomever I encounter a gift: a smile, a compliment or flower.<br/>
Gratefully receive gifts. Keep wealth circulating by giving and receiving care, affection, appreciation and love</br>

<!-- I will put the Law of Giving into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. Wherever I go, and whoever I encounter, I will bring them a gift. The gift maybe a compliment , a flower, or a prayer. Today, I will give something to everyone I come into contact with, and so I will begin the process of circulating joy, wealth, and affluence in my life and in the lives of others.
  2. Today I will gratefully receive all gifts that life has to offer me. I will receive the gifts of nature; sunlight and the sound of birds singing, or spring showers. I will also be open to receiving from others, whether it be in the form of a material gift, money, a compliment, or a prayer.
  3. I will make a commitment to keep wealth circulating in my life by giving and receiving life's most precious gifts: the gifts of caring, affection, appreciation, and love. Each time I meet someone, I will silently wish them happiness, joy, and laughter.-->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
The Fake Traditionalist<br/>
Don't let the person who seem to be a zealot for tradition fool you. Notice how unconventional they really are.<br/>

<!-- What a wise old man said -->

**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Failure is success if we learn from it." - Malcolm Forbes <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->

**I'm thankful to:** have clothes on my back. <br/>

<!-- what is holding me back all these years -->

**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Things "Emotionally Intelligent People **DO NOT DO**:" <br/>
They DO NOT just become close friends with anyone. <br/>
They recognize true trust and intimacy as something you build, and something you want to be discerning with whom you share. <br/>
But they're not guarded or closed as they are simply mindful and aware of who they allow into theirs lives and hearts. They are kind to all, but truly open to few. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?"
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When or Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->

**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [] Why did I want to pursue this goal to begin with, and has anything changed? <br/>
- [] What do I hope to achieve in life? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals

<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!--
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->

## **Long Term Goals:**

<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

## **To be 1% better than yesterday!!**

<!-- learn "the code works" isn't where I stop; it's where I start!!
  - step 1 ==> always write quality code that fulfils the spec

    1. Is it valuable to make it faster?
    2. easier to document?
    3. more reusable?
    4. more reliable? -->
<!-- learn write it THREE times
  - First time ==> write the software to prove myself that the solution is possible;
  - Second time ==> make it work
  - Third time ==> make it work right
  - throw away code and start over will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub. -->
<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 43 (Monday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today will be finish up Day 24 & 25 material to read more and practice on building Udemy app with TypeScript. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?

<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->

## Room to improve?

<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection.
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority.

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->

- Try to code with lesser research and reference, embrace learning through failures, next 4 week to train myself yellow duck methods.
- Code with think aloud methods.
- Time Management
  - Where is the balance between learn, work, life and rest.
- Slow typing speed
  - How to speed up typing speed?
- Reading speed
  - Comprehended the logic but not the code.
- Memory skills
  - What causing me to lose my memory?
- "Make it Better" <== my personal workflow
  - learn to throw away code and start over again will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub.
- Logic & analytical thinking:
  - I should find a way to think in logical frames to solve problems.
  - important to have strong logical and analytical thinking capabilities to decide which language or piece of code best suited for each user story.
- Detail-oriented:
  - how to ensure the precise accuracy in writing pieces of code?
  - important to have strong attention to detail to protect my work, remain efficient and prevent bugs.
- Creativity:
  - learn to recognize the potential for technological solutions to everyday problems.
  - important to understand how React Native + TypeScript works, the more creative ways to solve potential problems.
- Resourcefulness + independence:
  - able to complete individual tasks and later combine them together with other.
  - important to remain resourceful and to habe confidence in my own ability to find a solution to any coding problem that might arise.
- Curiosity:
  - important to remain curious about coding and various languages and technologies.
- Time-boxing to strict 90 minutes per task with a 20min rest break.

- Day 38 ==> Continue to work on React Native + TypeScript exercise project to practice concepts, its feature, workflows and how to enhance it with material UI CSS fundamentals.

- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.

- Required improvement on technical writing of learning experience and daily lesson task reviews with a better layout.

- Read 1 chapter / 30min of Computational Thinking.

- add one more column for non-technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- try to practice these 9 principles for 52 weeks:
  1. Understand the Basics;
  2. Write Easy To Understand And Logical Programming Codes
  3. Try Analyzing my Code
  4. Read As Many Books I Can
  5. Talking to a fellow programmer
  6. Help others In Solving Their Problems
  7. Contribution to Open Source and Signing-up mailing lists
  8. Practice It Many Times As Possible
  9. Participate In Different Events

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

==============================================================================

## MY GOAL for May

### Aim to create a personal work flow of writing code from scratch to practice and improve my skills.

==============================================================================

#### Possible Project Work

**I wished to:** <br/>

1. Create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket
5. A food & nutrition app that provide food portions in smaller sizes to stimulate reduction of food consumption and reduction of food waste
6. A wellness app that provides more scientifically proven and generally understood advices to a health diet
7. An app to provide a more balanced healthcare for the various developed nations
8. An wellness and diet advisor app based on blood test result.
9. A bookstore app that provides a unified platform for all kinds of books and magazines.
10. A multilingual recipe app that provides recipes and nutrition facts to promote eat well eat healthy Southeast-Asia Cuisine.
11. Build a Chatbot that can provide a personalized service to the user based on the user's input
