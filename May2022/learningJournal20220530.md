# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 22:
Make an important or Difficult Decision:
  The creative intelligence of my subconscious mind knows what is best for me.
  Its tendency is always life-ward, and it reveals to me the right decision, which blessed all concerned.
  I give thanks for the answer which I know will come to me.
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Giving: **Give, thou shalt Receive** <br/>
Today, bring whomever I encounter a gift: a smile, a compliment or flower.<br/>
Gratefully receive gifts. Keep wealth circulating by giving and receiving care, affection, appreciation and love</br>
<!-- I will put the Law of Giving into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. Wherever I go, and whoever I encounter, I will bring them a gift. The gift maybe a compliment , a flower, or a prayer. Today, I will give something to everyone I come into contact with, and so I will begin the process of circulating joy, wealth, and affluence in my life and in the lives of others.
  2. Today I will gratefully receive all gifts that life has to offer me. I will receive the gifts of nature; sunlight and the sound of birds singing, or spring showers. I will also be open to receiving from others, whether it be in the form of a material gift, money, a compliment, or a prayer.
  3. I will make a commitment to keep wealth circulating in my life by giving and receiving life's most precious gifts: the gifts of caring, affection, appreciation, and love. Each time I meet someone, I will silently wish them happiness, joy, and laughter.-->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Everyone Wants More Power<br/>
When in doubt, assume that people are doing what they are doing and saying what they are saying because they want more power, no less. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man always said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Courage is not having the strength to go on; it is going on when you don't have the strength." - Theodore Roosevelt <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful to:** have life lessons that can help me grow. <br/>

<!-- what has holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Core Traits of a **"SOCIALLY INTELLIGENT PERSON"**: <br/>
They DO NOT post anything online they would be embarrassed to show to a parent, explain to a child, or have an employer find. <br/>
Aside from the fact that at some point or another, one if not all of those things will come to pass, posting anything that I am not confident to support means I am not being genuine to myself <br/>(I am behaving on behalf of the part of me that wants other people to validate it). <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When would this work?
- Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [x] Evaluate what I am doing, why I am doing it, and where accomplishing it will take me? If I don't have a good answer, then STOP!! <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

<!-- Coding as a Career -->
<!-- learn remind myself how much I have to learn -->
<!-- learn stop trying to prove myself right
  - ask myself how I can make this better?
  - actively look for where I am wrong? -->
<!-- learn "the code works" isn't where I stop; it's where I start!!
  - step 1 ==> always write quality code that fulfils the spec
  - step 2 ==> Now, make it better!!
    1. Is it valuable to make it faster?
    2. easier to document?
    3. more reusable?
    4. more reliable? -->
<!-- learn write it THREE times
  - First time ==> write the software to prove myself that the solution is possible;
  - Second time ==> make it work
  - Third time ==> make it work right
  - throw away code and start over will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub. -->
<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

<!-- Strategies that help me to push through beginner phase:
  - I will continue to make programs from scratch
    - start writing my own code, without instruction
    - start with an empty file, and type every line of code myself
    - look at other people's code
    - Analyse other people's code
    - learn a little bit about how it works, then write it myself
  - I will start small, very small
    - make something that would be useful in real life
    - start with load of make text-based games, time tracker, to-do list, or something to automate calculations
    - use these projects to learn all of the features of JavaScript, React, and TypeScript
  - write lots of code
    - I have to make software to gain skill
    - The program I make will not do much, and it will probably have messy code, but that doesn't matter
    - read some theory, get some advice, and make a new program
    - each program I make should be bigger and better than the last
    - Repeat these steps for long enough, and I will become an expert
  - ask for help
    - it's OK to ask for help only if I do these:
      - always try to google my problem first
      - analyse the answer and learn the cause behind my error
      - this way, when I encounter the same error again, I will already know how to fix it
    - If I constantly hitting unsolvable problems, that probably means that my project is too ambitious
    - Scale it back, and make something smaller until my skills improve
  - asking help the right way
    - **paste in my exact error message**
      - this is the most important piece of information
    - if there is no error message, **explain what I expected to happen, and what actually happened**
      - something like "I expect it to output 5, but it actually outputs 7"
      - Often, the problem isn't in my code, it's in my expectations
      - If I don't explain what I expected, I will get answers like "the code looks fine" and "what is the problem?"
    - **paste in my broken code**
      - It's very difficult to debug a problem without seeing the code
      - paste it all in, if it's not too big, because people will run my code to investigate the problem
      - If there is too much code, paste it into a Github Gist or Pastebin.com, then put the link into my question
    - **format my code correctly**
      - don't just paste in my code like normal text
      - learn how to format my code nicely so it is easy to read

```python
# It should look like this:

def foobar
  puts 1 + 2 / 3
end
```

```python
# Not like this:

def foobar
puts 1+2/3
end
```

- **mention what I have already tried**
  - this tells people that I've already put in some effort.

- **try to use correct terminology**
  - make an effort to learn the common terms, and use them correctly.

## Personal Notes

**Day 57 (Monday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday will be building tracking app, breakdown SHARE Nx structure, define programming terminology, read on Unit Test. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
- **Fundamental**
  - [The five basic elements](https://study.com/academy/lesson/5-basic-elements-of-programming.html), in programming are:
    - **Input**: getting data and commands into the computer
    - **Output**: getting your results out of the computer
    - **Variables and data structures**: storing information, which may change over time
    - **Mathematical operations (arithmetic)**: Performing mathematical calculations on your data
    - **Looping and conditionals**: testing to see if a condition is true of false, and cycling through a set of instructions until some condition is met

  - [Computer Programming - Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_basics.htm)
  - [Programming Terminology](https://careerkarma.com/blog/programming-terminology/)

  - [Naming Conventions](https://unional.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/pages/default/draft/naming-conventions.html)
    - Single letter names
      - Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming.
    - Name casing
      - Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances. eslint: camelCase jscs: requireCamelCaseOrUpperCaseIdentifiers
      - Use PascalCase when naming constructors or classes. eslint: new-cap jscs: requireCapitalizedConstructors
      - Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function's name.
      - Use PascalCase when you export a singleton / function library / bare object.
    - Name prefixes
      - Use a leading underscore _ when naming private properties. eslint: no-underscore-dangle jscs: disallowDanglingUnderscores
    - this reference
      - Don't save references to this. Use arrow functions or Function#bind. jscs: disallowNodeTypes
    - File naming
      - If your file exports a single class, your filename should be exactly the name of the class.

  - [JSON Web Token: What it is, How it Works and How to verify](https://krify.co/json-overview/)
    - A JWT is self-contained when the user creates one;
    - it has all the necessary pieces I need to do the things I want to do on a server packaged up inside it
  - **Structure of the token**
    - JSON web token is sent via the header of HTTP requests.
      - Here's what one looks like:
        - There are three main steps, separated by a "."
          - [a header](https://i.imgur.com/yQ2ORho.png)
            - A header in a JWT is mostly used to describe the cryptographic operations applied to the JWT like signing/decryption technique used on it
            - It can also contain the data about the media/content type of the information we are sending
            - This information is present as a JSON object then this JSON object is encoded to BASE64URL
            - The cryptographic operations in the header define whether the JWT is signed/unsigned or encrypted and are so then what algorithm techniques to use
          - [a payload](https://i.imgur.com/SPqAVV8.png)
            - The payload is the part of the JWT where all the user data is actually added
            - This data is also referred to as the 'claims' of the JWT
            - This information is readable by anyone so it is always advised to not put any confidential information in here
            - This part generally contains user information
            - This information is present as a JSON object then this JSON object is encoded to BASE64URL
            - We can put as many claims as we want inside a payload, though unlike header, no claims are mandatory in a payload
          - [a signature](https://i.imgur.com/HclwanR.png)
            - This is the third part of JWT and used to verify the authenticity of token
            - BASE64URL encoded header and payload are joined together with dot(.) and it is then hashed using the hashing algorithm defined in a header with a secret key
            - This signature is then appended to header and payload using dot(.) which forms our actual token header.payload.signature

```jwt
<!--  actual token example -->
header:
{
  "alg" : "HS256",        <!-- 'typ' gives us the type of the header this information packet is -->
  "typ" : "JWT"           <!-- 'alg' tells us about the encryption algorithm used -->
}

Payload:
{
     "userId":"b07f85be-45da",                  <!-- userId is the ID of the user we are storing -->
     "iss": "https://provider.domain.com/",     <!-- 'iss tells us about the issuer -->
     "sub": "auth/some-hash-here",              <!-- 'sub' stands for subject -->
     "exp": 153452683                           <!-- 'exp' stands for expiration date -->
}

Secret: learningJWT                   <!-- 'learningJWT' is the secret key used to sign the token -->

HASHINGALGO( base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload),secret)        <!-- signature is then appended to header and payload using dot(.) which forms our actual token header.payload.signature -->
```

```JWT
// JSON Web TOken
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MTIzNDU2Nzg5LCJuYW1lIjoiSm9zZXBoIn0.OpOSSw7e485LOP5PrzScxHb7SR6sAOMRckfFwi4rp7o
```

- _JWTs are credentials, which can grant access to resources. Be careful where you paste them! We do not record tokens, all validation and debugging is done on the client side._

- **step 11: creating a JWT**
  - go to jwt.io
  - scroll to [PAYLOAD](https://i.imgur.com/1kV5kty.png)
  - inside PAYLOAD input this
    - {
          "userId": "6294fdf061327d1168058599"
          "email": "test@test.com"
          "password": "mypassword"
    }
  - inside VERIFY SIGNATURE
    - key in some secret key
  - finally JWT will encoded to something this to identify the user
    - eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MTIzNDU2Nzg5LCJuYW1lIjoiSm9zZXBoIn0.OpOSSw7e485LOP5PrzScxHb7SR6sAOMRckfFwi4rp7o

```javaScript
// @filename: ./src/routes/authRoutes.js
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
// 11.1 import jsonwebtoken library here
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const User = mongoose.model('User');

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/signup', async (req, res) => {

  const {email, password} = req.body;

try {
  const user = new User({email, password});

 await user.save();

// 11.2 instead sending back a response, we use JWT to send that back passing in 2 arguments
   const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, 'MY_SECRET_KEY');

// 11.3 delete the plain text and insert an object with an token prop that contain token but since identical I can condense it into 1 name
  res.send({ token });
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(422).send(err.message);
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

- 11.4 now let test it out with thunder client
  - 11.5 change to new email if same email will have error
  - 11.6 click send
  - 11.7 i will get my token that look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/XYx9Hol.png)
  - now we can use the token to validate the user

- **step 12: writing up JSON Web Tokens**
  - let say we have a new user signup, we will use the new token to validate the user

```bash
# 12.2 @filename: ./ProjectFolder/tracker-server/src
mkdir middlewares
cd middlewares
touch requireAuth.js
```

```javaScript
// @filename: ./src/middlewares/requireAuth.js
// 12.3 add in some require statement
// 12.4 require jsonwebtoken
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
// 12.5 require mongoose
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
// 12.6 inside the mongoose library I want to access the User model that I created
const User = mongoose.model('User');

// 12.7 let's define a export function, a plain function calling request, response and next function 
// why? because if we determine that a user dose successfully have a JWT token then we can move on to the next middleware
// if no middleware to run, it will run the ultimate request handler
module.exports = (req, res, next) => {
  // 12.9 pull the authorization header from req.header
  const { authorization } = req.headers;

// 12.10 then immediately do an if else to check the user
  if (!authorization) {
    return res.status(401).send({ error: 'You must be logged in.' });
  }

// 12.11 if user passed the check then they must provide an valid token, let's try to extract the token out of the authorization header here
// let's say authorization === 'Bearer with my jsonwebtoken'
// the empty string is for the token
  const token = authorization.replace('Bearer ', '');

// 12.12 to validate the token
// now I can call jwt.verify with 3 argument token I want to validate, my secret key, and my callback function that will run after JWT have some check on that token
// this is where we used async with callback function passing in 2 argument error and payload
    jwt.verify(token, 'MY_SECRET_KEY', async (err, payload) => {


// 12.13 callback to look at the error object on userId inside the database
   if (err) {
      return res.status(401).send({ error: 'You must be logged in.' });
    }

// 12.14 after I verify this is a legitimate token, I can try to extract the userId from the payload
    const { userId } = payload;

// 12.15 we can use the {userId} to look up the user collection from mongoDB
    const user = await User.findById(userId);

// 12.16 now I will assign this variable to req object
    req.user = user;
    next();
  });
};
```

- 12.8 establish a mechanism how user share token with me
  - now go to thunder client
  - create a new request
  - make a GET request to localhost:4000
  - GET-->HEADER
    - input Authorization: Bearer <token>
  - go to POST localhost:4000/signup-->Response & copy this <token>
    - "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiI2Mjk1ODNkMDZmZjU2YjI0NzFjN2ExOWYiLCJpYXQiOjE2NTM5NjU3NzZ9.MlIwqG0bj_pg_f6DfWN6gTW07-Kh5KyjKnmOV-SJERM" without the double quote and paste after _Bearer_

```javaScript
// @filename: ./src/index.js
require("./models/User");

const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const authRoutes = require("./routes/authRoutes");
// 12.17 come here to require the requireAuth from the middlewares requireAuth file
const requireAuth = require("./middlewares/requireAuth");

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(authRoutes);

const mongoUri = 'mongodb+srv://admin:p%4055w0rD@cluster0.cxviw.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority'

mongoose.connect(mongoUri);

mongoose.connection.on("connected", () => {
  console.log("Connected to mongo instance");
});
mongoose.connection.on("error", (err) => {
  console.error("Error connecting to mongo", err);
});

// 12.1 add some code here so the user can only access if they have a valid token to do so we need create a new folder
// 12.18 pass in a second request handler after "/"
app.get("/", requireAuth, (req, res)=> {
  // 12.19 now replace 'yo yo yo' with a string literal using backtick` ` to print out user's email
  res.send(`Your email: ${req.user.email}`);
});

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log("Listening on port 4000");
});
```

- 12.20 let's do a quick test
  - go to thunder client
  - do a GET request localhost:4000
  - click send and i should see [this](https://i.imgur.com/HfEuz3B.png)
- 12.21 let' do an experiment
  - change an character inside the token
  - this is what i [get](https://i.imgur.com/3yWYUik.png)!!! hahaha so no messy around with tokens

  - [logic](https://i.imgur.com/kuLDuLR.png)

- **understanding hashing**
  - go to tool [md5 Hash Generator](https://miraclesalad.com/webtools/md5.php) to understand how bcrypt works
  - hashing algorithms are very [single dimensional](https://i.imgur.com/9r8ZtDd.png)
  - after we hashing our password we cannot figure out what the input was
  - [example diagram](https://i.imgur.com/peO0CMp.png)
  - [an attack a malicious user can do named rainbow table attack](https://i.imgur.com/LCy8694.png)
  - we will add one additional step to prevent this attack by [generating a "salt"](https://i.imgur.com/1hTCc1S.png) by concat password with a randomly generated string of chars (salt)
  - [now the attacker must have a very comprehensive list](https://i.imgur.com/TOFGAHj.png)

- **step 1: automate salting & hashing process**

```javascript
// @filename: ./src/models/User.js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
// 1.1 import the bcrypt library
const bcrypt = require("bcrypt");

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: {
    type: String,
    unique: true,
    required: true
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  }
});


//**THIS IS FOR NEW USER PASSWORD**
// 1.1 find my userSchema underneath I gonna say userSchema.pre and pass in 2 arguments
// this is call a pre-save hook
userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {

// 1.2 let's do something inside here with a if else to check user password if is a plain text password it will generate a "salt"
// why use function keyword because we are using this; keyword 
  const user = this;
  if (!user.isModified('password')) {
    return next();
  }

// 1.3 generate "salt" with bcrypt and call function
  bcrypt.genSalt(10, (err, salt) => {
    if (err) {
      return next(err);
    }

  // 1.4 generate hash with bcrypt with 2 argument user.password password user first sign up & salt a random string of chars to prevent rainbow table attack & 1 callback that be be called when the hashing process is completed. callback will run error object and resulting hash
    bcrypt.hash(user.password, salt, (err, hash) => {

// 1.5 use if else to check
      if (err) {
        return next(err);
      }
// 1.6 if no error it will update user password
      user.password = hash;
// 1.7 call next to save the user
      next();
    });
  });
});


//**This is for COMPARISON PROVIDE BY USER TO THE ONE STORE IN DB**
// 1.8 here will write some code to automate the password checking process:
userSchema.methods.comparePassword = function(candidatePassword) {
  const user = this;

// 1.9 I use promise here is to make use of async await while comparing password
// whenever we use a Promise, we need callback function
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // 1.10 we use bcrypt library to automate 
    bcrypt.compare(candidatePassword, user.password, (err, isMatch) => {
      if (err) {
        return reject(err);
      }

      if (!isMatch) {
        return reject(false);
      }

      resolve(true);
    });
  });
};

mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

- **step 2: The Sign-In Route**
  - write some code to log our user in

```javascript
// @filename: ./src/routes/authRoutes.js
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const User = mongoose.model('User');

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/signup', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;

  try {
    const user = new User({ email, password });
    await user.save();

    const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, 'MY_SECRET_KEY');
    res.send({ token });
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(422).send(err.message);
  }
});

// 2.1 add in a post request handler 'router.post'
// whenever someone call sign-in route, it will run this callback function
// I expect they provide me an email or password so
router.post(            // router.post() refers to submits data to a specified resource to be processed
  '/signin',            // specified resource 'signin' to be processed
   async              // use async because mongoose need to reach out to mongoDB which take some time
    (req, res)        // callback function with object 'request' & 'response'
    => {              // arrow function to execute some context
  const { email, password } = req.body;   //the email & password properties will be on req.body properties

  if (!email || !password) {              // if no email || no password let's give up and return error message
    return res.status(422).send({ error: 'Must provide email and password' });  // sent back a response 422 to the user with an error message

  }

// 2.1 once we get pass the check we can now go through the login process
// we will uses the email supplied by 'const User = mongoose.model('User')' model
  const user =                // and assign to user variable
  await 
  User.findOne(               // using the findOne() method
    { email });               // taking in one object

  if (!user) {                // if no user and return error message
    return res.status(422).send({ error: 'Invalid password or email' });
  }

//remember if something go wrong in the comparison process promise return is going to be rejected
  try {         // so we wrap it with a try catch statement
    await user.comparePassword(password);
    const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, 'MY_SECRET_KEY');
    res.send({ token });
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(422).send({ error: 'Invalid password or email' });
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

- **step 3: Testing Signup & Signin**
  - go to mongoDB and delete all the users data with plain text password
  - then go to thunder client and test it out
    - POST request --> localhost:4000/signup
    - [signup successful](https://i.imgur.com/qEq6EE1.png)
  - go over to mongoDB
    - now password is [salted](https://i.imgur.com/OwfNE3m.png)
  - go to thunder client
    - POST request --> localhost:4000/signin
    - [signin successful with JWT](https://i.imgur.com/MCxRuRF.png)
  - to make sure it works, let's try to have a fail signin
    - POST request --> localhost:4000/signin
    - [wrong password](https://i.imgur.com/A6NmmJJ.png)
    - i get an [password error message](https://i.imgur.com/pv31D8h.png)
    - [error email](https://i.imgur.com/3vbu7Fc.png)
    - [no email, no password](https://i.imgur.com/LjLWOR8.png)

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
