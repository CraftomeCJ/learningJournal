# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 1:
CLEANSE MY MIND
  Divine love fills my soul.
  Divine right action is mine.
  Divine harmony governs my life.
  Divine peace fills my soul.
  Divine beauty is mine.
  Divine joy fills my soul.
  I am divinely guided in all ways.
  I am illumined from on High.
  I know and believe that I will receive a measure of life, love, truth, and beauty that transcends my boldest dreams.
  I know that universal love and generosity embrace me. 
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Least Effort: **"Is that so?" Apply the Power of Non-Resistance**<br/>
Shows the good through inner non-resistance. <br/>
Accept people, situations and events as they occur. Take responsibility for my situation and for all events seen as problems. <br/>
Relinquish the need to defend my point of view. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Least Effort into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. I will practice Acceptance. Today I will accept people, situations and events as they occur. I will know that this moment is as it should be, because the whole universe is as it should be. I will not struggle against the whole universe by struggling against this moment. My acceptance is total and complete. I accept things as they are this moment, not as I wish they were.
  2. Having accepted things as they are, I will take Responsibility for my situation and for all those events I see as problems. I know that taking responsibility means not blaming anyone or anything for my situation (and this includes myself). I also know that every problem is an opportunity in disguise, and this alertness to opportunities allows me to take this moment and transform it into a greater benefit.
  3. Today my awareness will remain established in Defenselessness. I will give up the need to defend my point of view. I will feel no need to convince or persuade others to accept my point of view. I will remain open to all view and not be rigidly attached to any one of them.-->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
The Appearance of Naïveté <br/>
Those who make a show or display of innocence are often the least innocent af all. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Self-discipline without talent can often achieve astounding results, <br/>
whereas talent without self-discipline inevitably dooms itself to failure." - Sydney J. Harris <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm grateful for:** and appreciate the good in my life, and more good will come to me.

<!-- what is holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
The Psychology of DAILY ROUTINE: <br/>
<br/>
As children, routine gives us a feeling of safety. As adults, it gives us a feeling of purpose<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, those two feelings are more similar than you'd think (at least, their origin is the same). <br/>
It's the same thing as the fear of the unknown: <br/>
As children, we don't know which way is left, let alone why we're alive or whether or not a particular activity we've never done before is going to be scary or harmful. <br/> When we're adults engaging with routine-ness, we can comfort ourselves with the simple idea of "I know how to do this, I've done it before." <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When or Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions of the day?**

- [] How much better is it to be known for doing well by many than for living extravagantly? <br/>
- [] How much worthy than spending on sticks and stones is it to spend on people? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

## What difficulties did I encounter and How do I solve the issues?
<!-- This is where I write down the problem and write down the steps for solving the issues I had encountered-->
<!-- example 1. While setting up ios & android simulator and emulator, face a minor connectivity issue with my android phone. error message "Could not load expo Network response timed out"
  After asking Mr Google, I found a few solutions:
   - installed Android Studio
   - turnoff my firewall
   - setup Android Studio Emulator
![Error Msg](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/Screenshot1.png "style=width:200 height: 200") -->
**Project difficulties:** <br/>

1. A complete failure today. Utterly disappointed with myself. Unable to complete building Login Screen from ground up.

Error after error from npm to expo to yarn to js build even after trying out different starter files. Spent way too much time on trying to resolve the issue.

Have to find a way to improve my logic thinking further, and to make it more efficient. I will keep my journal short today.

Have a 4hr sleep to recover my tired mind and fatigue body. Tomorrow try again with the code without typescript involved. Disappointing and unproductive day.
## What other issues trying to resolve? <br/>

1. Time Management - Where is the balance between learn, work, life and rest.
2. Slow typing speed - How to speed up typing speed?
3. Reading speed - Comprehended the logic but not the code.
4. Logic thinking - I should find a way to think logically.
5. Memory skills - What causing me to lose my memory?
6. Accuracy - how to add code with precise accuracy.

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

==============================================================================

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Try to code without research and reference, fail miserably, next 4 week to train yellow duck methods.

- Code using think aloud methods.
