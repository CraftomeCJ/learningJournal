# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 20:
SOLVE A PROBLEM:
  My subconscious knows the answer.
  It is responding to me now. 
  I give thanks because I know the infinite spirit of my subconscious knows all the things and is revealing the perfect answer to me.
  My real conviction is now setting free the majestic and glory of my subconscious mind.
  I rejoice that it is so.
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Intention and Desire: **"Make a list of desires"**<br/>
Inherent in every intention and desire is the mechanics for its fulfillment. <br/>
Trust that when things don't seem to go my way, there is a reason. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Intention and Desire into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. I will make a list of all my desires. I will carry this list with me whenever I go. I will look at it before I go to sleep at night. I will look at it when I wake up in the morning. 
  2. I will release this list of my desires and surrender it to the womb of creation, trusting that when things don't seem to go my way, there is a reason, and that the cosmic plan has designs for me much grander than even those I have conceived.
  3. I will remind myself to practice present-moment awareness in all my actions. I will refuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate the quality of the attention in the present moment. I will accept the present as it is, and manifest the future through my deepest, most cherished intentions and desires.-->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Demanding Equality<br/>
Many of those who demand equality across the board are actually deploying another power strategy, redistributing people's rewards in a way that they determine. <br/>Judge and reward people on the quality of their work. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Waking up this morning. I smile. A fortune of 86,400 brand new $econds are before me. I vow to spend it wisely and fully in each moment" - Some old man said.. <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful to:** have things I'm good at. <br/>

<!-- what is holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Core Traits of a **"SOCIALLY INTELLIGENT PERSON"**: <br/>
They DO NOT speak in definitives about people, politics, or ideas. <br/>
The fastest way to sound unintelligent is to say "This idea is wrong." (That idea may be wrong for you, but it exists because it is right to someone else.) <br/> Intelligent people say, "I don't personally understand this idea or agree with it." To speak definitively about any one person or idea is to be blind to the multitude of perspectives that exist on it. It is the definition of closed-minded and short-sightedness. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When or Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [x] Simply knowing is not enough. It must be absorbed into the muscles and the body. it must become part of us. Or we risk losing it the second that we experience stress or difficulty. <br/>
- [x] Do I think I'm doing something of value with my life? Why or why not? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

    1. Is it valuable to make it faster?
    2. easier to document?
    3. more reusable?
    4. more reliable? -->
<!-- learn write it THREE times
  - First time ==> write the software to prove myself that the solution is possible;
  - Second time ==> make it work
  - Third time ==> make it work right
  - throw away code and start over will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub. -->
<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to my Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 46 (Thursday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday will be learning advance state management with useContext to manage global state management, work on a Udemy's Blog App. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
- **Fundamental**
  - [The five basic elements](https://study.com/academy/lesson/5-basic-elements-of-programming.html), in programming are:
    - Input: getting data and commands into the computer
    - Output: getting your results out of the computer
    - Looping and conditionals: testing to see if a condition is true of false, and cycling through a set of instructions until some condition is met
    - Mathematical operations (arithmetic): Performing mathematical calculations on your data
    - Variables and data structures: storing information, which may change over time

### Restaurant Search App Re-enact with TypeScript

(Aim to explicitly implement a type-safe react-native app)

- **With React Native + TypeScript Source Code**

```TypeScript
// @filename: src/screens/SearchScreen.tsx
import {
  Text,
  StyleSheet,
  ScrollView
} from 'react-native';
import React, { useState } from 'react';

import SearchBar from '../components/SearchBar'
import useResults from '../hooks/useResults'
import ResultList from '../components/ResultList'

const SearchScreen: React.FC = () => {

    const [term, setTerm] = useState<string>('');
    const [searchApi, results, errorMessage] = useResults();

    const filterResultByPrice = (price: string) => {
      // price === '$' || price === '$$' || price === '$$$'
      return results.filter((result: { price: string; }) => {
        return result.price === price;
        });
    };

    return (

      <>
        <SearchBar
        term={term}
        onTermChange={setTerm}
        onTermSubmit={() => searchApi(term)}
        />

  {errorMessage ? <Text>{errorMessage}</Text> : null}

<ScrollView>
        <ResultList
        results={filterResultByPrice('$')}
        title="Cost Effective"
        />

        <ResultList
        results={filterResultByPrice('$$')}
        title="Bit Pricier"
        />

        <ResultList
        results={filterResultByPrice('$$$')}
        title="Big Spender"
        />
</ScrollView>
</>
    );
  };

export default SearchScreen;

const styles = StyleSheet.create({});
```

## Exercise of the Day: TypeScript **_Revisited_**

[x] **Challenge:** Read ==> TypeScript Quickly (aim to improve TypeScript Implementations)

## Summary

- What is [TypeScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/web-wednesday/what-is-typescript)?
  - TS is a superset of JS. A program written in TS has to be transpiled into JS first, then it can be executed in the browser or a standalone JS engine.
- How TS catch errors?
  - Errors are caught by the TS static code analyzer as I type, even before I compile code with TS compiler (tsc).
- What is the benefit of using TS?
  - TS gives me the benefits of statically type languages when and where I want, without stopping me from using the good old dynamics JS objects when I want them.
- What is TS specification?
  - TS follows the latest specification of ECMAScript and adds to them types, interfaces, decorators, class member variables (fields), generics, enums, the keywords public, protected, private, readonly, the new keywords const, let, and more.
- How to start a TS project?
  - To start a new TS project, run command tsc --init in any directory. It'll create the tsconfig.json file for me, containing all the compiler's options with most of them commented out. Uncomment them as needed.

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

==============================================================================

## So do I know now?

- **CONCEPTS**
- Define explicitly, implicitly?
  - [Explicitly](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-implicit-and-explicit-in-programming?share=1): I define the 'types' of a variable or a function parameter.
  - [Implicitly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39716627/what-is-the-difference-between-explicitly-and-implicitly-in-programming-lang): I don't define the 'type' of a variable or a function parameter. The compiler will infer (guess) it.

- What is type widening?
  - If I declared a variable without initializing it with a specific value, TS uses the internal types null || undefined, which are converted to any.

- What is type narrowing?
  - An attempt to apply conditional statements to refine a variable's type.

- **typeof padding === 'number'**
- What do 'typeof' do?
  - I use it to find out the actual type of _padding_ at runtime
- How about 'instanceof'? What it do?
  - allow me to check the actual object type at runtime
- What is the difference between 'typeof' and 'instanceof?
  - _typeof_ is used with the built-in TS types, while _instanceof_ is used with custom types.

```TypeScript
// basic primitive type annotation
let firstNameEasyTiobo: string;
const someNumericLah: number; 
const isValidAnot: boolean;
const absenceSomeValueHar: void;
let notAllowAnyhowAssignLor: unknown;
const noAnyHowAnyHor: any;
const uniqueIDMeh: symbol;
const runForeverNoReturnWor: never;

// Symbols type as object properties
const order = Symbol('orderID');  //create new symbol

const myOrder = {
  order: '123'
};
console.log(myOrder[order]); // this prints '123'

// special lai liao
const purposelyNoValueLei: null;
const funcNoReturnVarNoReturn: undefined;
// can assign to any type, but best to combo with other types
function getName(): string | null {
  return null;
}

// never;
const logger = () => {
  while (true) {      // this function never ends... siao liao
    console.log('I am running forever');
  }
}

// more advance liao catch no balla explore later
let arrayOfNumberListMah: Number[];
const cannotChangeListHor: [string, number];
const objAInstanceOfKeyPairs: {name: string; age: number };
```

```TypeScript
// padLeft with the any type
const padLeft = (
  value: string, 
  padding: any
  ): string => {

  if (typeof padding === 'number') { //a numeric argument, generate spaces
    return Array(padding + 1).join(' ') + value;
  }

  if (typeof padding === 'string') {  //a string, using concatenation
    return padding + value;
  }

throw new Error(`Expected string or number, got '${padding}'.`); 
// if the type is not string or number, throw an error
  }

// run the padLeft function
console.log( padLeft('Hello World', 5)); // return 'Hello World'

console.log( padLeft('Hello World', 'Anya says ')); // return 'Anya says Hello World'

console.log( padLeft('Hello World', true));  // sobsob! runtime error
```

```TypeScript
// padLeft with the union type
const padLeft = (
  value: string, 
  // what is this funny straight line " | " hor?
// it's a union type leh, allow me to express some of the several types we have
  padding: string | number  // <== like this hor only allow a string or a number as second argument understand bo?
  ): string => {

  if (typeof padding === 'number') {  // typeof?? simi lai eh? go see concept Q&A lah..
    return Array(padding + 1).join(' ') + value;
  }

  if (typeof padding === 'string') {
    return padding + value;
  }

// The never type of an impossible value
  else {
    return padding;   //this else block is never executed
  }

}
```

- **TIP**
  - Add explicit type annotation for function or methods signatures and public class members.
  - Can use keywords: _type_, _class_ and _interface_ to declare my own types.
  - If I need to declare a variable that can hold values of more than one type, DO NOT use the type _any_; use a union type such as _let paddingStr: string | number_
    - another way is to declare two separate variables: _let paddingStr: string; let paddingNum: number_
  - Benefits of using the _union_ type is that IDE have an autocomplete feature that will prompt me with allowed argument types, so I won't even have the chance to make a mistake.

## Do you know?

- I can create custom types with the _type_ keyword

- **CONCEPTS**
  - [type keyword](https://medium.com/@rm.dev/typescript-type-keyword-explained-21ada293ab70)
    - allows me to declare a new type or type alias over the current type
  - Which keyword to use for declaring a custom type like _Patient_?
    - If the custom type doesn't need to be used for instantiating objects at runtime, use _type_ or _interface_
  - [Anonymous Types, Type Aliases, and Interface Declarations](https://betterprogramming.pub/typescript-anonymous-types-type-aliases-and-interface-declarations-b60bc8a08f8c)
  - [Type Systems: Structural vs. Nominal typing explained](https://medium.com/@thejameskyle/type-systems-structural-vs-nominal-typing-explained-56511dd969f4)
  - [Understand TypeScript's Structural Type System](https://medium.com/codex/understand-typescripts-structural-type-system-17167ae90b9f)
  - [Types, Type Systems, and TypeScript](https://codeburst.io/types-type-systems-and-typescript-4ac858298e5e)

```TypeScript
// let's try 'type' keyword first:
// let's say my app deals with patients represents by name, height and weight. Both height and weight are numbers, to improve readability, i can create aliases hinting at the units in which the height and weight are measured.
// declare alias types centimeter and kilogram
type Centimeter = number; // <-- this is a alias type, understand bo???
type Kilogram = number;

// now I can create a new Patient type and using the aliases I created earlier in its declaration
// declare a new type that uses aliases
type Patient = {      // declares the Patient type
  name: string; // <== TS primitive type, can use typeof to check
  height: Centimeter; // use the type alias Centimeter    // <== custom type create by me so need us instanceof to check
  weight: Kilogram;   // use the type alias Kilogram
}

// declarations of type aliases don't create code in the complied JS
// for example declare and initializing a variable a type's properties ==> Patient
let Patient: Patient = {   // I create an 'instance' using the object literal notation
  name: 'Tom Jerry',
  height: 180.4,
  weight: 80.2
}

// wah!! if i forget to mention the value of one of the properties, TS will release red tubifex worms to bite me... ouch...
let Patient: Patient = {
  name: 'Tom Jerry',
  height: 100
} 

// TS will scream:
// error TS2322: Type '{ name: string; height: number; }' is not assignable to type 'Patient'. 
// Property 'weight' is missing in type '{ name: string; height: number; }'.

// wow.. that's real pain in the gasss...

// if I don't know will i be using the particular estate anot, I can declare it as optional, by adding a question mark (?) to their name lah, but please hor DO NOT omit it har, ah bo boss TS worms can opened and boss TS will complain lah
type Patient = {
  name: string;
  height: Centimeter;
  weight?: Kilogram;    //weight property is now optional
}

let Patient: Patient = {  //now variable Patient is initialized without the weight property also no problem liao
  name: 'Tom Jerry',
  height: 100
}
```

```TypeScript
// Let's take a look of 'interfaces' keyword to declare a custom type.

// Suppose I want to write a function that can save information about a patient to a file.
// The function should take an object that represents a Patient, and I want to ensure that it has a specific properties of specific types.
// I can declare a custom Patient type as an interface like this:

interface Patient {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
}

function savePatient (patient: Patient): void {
  console.log('Saving ', patient)
}

const p: Patient = {
  firstName: 'Tom',
  lastName: 'Jerry',
  age: 20
};

savePatient(p);
```

```TypeScript
// experimental 1:
// remove lastName property on variable p
interface Patient {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
}

function savePatient (patient: Patient): void {
  console.log('Saving ', patient)
}

const p: Patient ={
  // Boss TS will scream at me loh tubifex worms crawling under the variable 'p' with the following error:
// Property 'lastName' is missing in type '{ firstName: string; age: number; }' but required in type 'Patient'. ts(2741)
  firstName: 'Tom',
  // <== missing lastName ==>
  age: 20
};

savePatient(p);

// experimental 2:
// try to access patient.lastName inside savePatient()
interface Patient {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
}

function savePatient (patient: Patient): void {
  console.log('Saving ', patient)
}

const p: Patient ={
  firstName: 'Tom',
  lastName: 'Jerry',
  age: 20
};

savePatient(patient.lastName);    // <== try to access Patient last name here but cannot

// if the Patient interface won't declare the lastName property, TS will throw an compiler error
// [ERR]: "Executed JavaScript Failed:" 
// JS code would just crash at runtime
```

```TypeScript
// experimental 3:
// remove the Patient type annotation.
// Notice the code is still valid and no errors are reported
interface Patient {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
}

function savePatient (patient: Patient): void {
  console.log('Saving ', patient);
}

const p ={      // <== remove the Patient type annotation
  firstName: 'Tom',
  lastName: 'Jerry',
  age: 20
};

savePatient(p);   // no error message

// WHY??? 
// the reason is that Boss TS uses a structural type system, which means that if two different types include the same members, the types are considered compatible.
```

- **TIP**
  - I can use the question mark to define optional properties in classes or interfaces hor.
  - also can use type keyword to declare a type alias for a function signature.

==============================================================================

- **JARGON in laymen terms:**
  - [Explicitly](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-implicit-and-explicit-in-programming?share=1)
    - I define the 'types' of a variable or a function parameter.
  - [Implicitly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39716627/what-is-the-difference-between-explicitly-and-implicitly-in-programming-lang)
    - I don't define the 'type' of a variable or a function parameter. The compiler will infer (guess) it.
  - [invoke](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/invoke/)
    - To activate/call a function || routine in a program 
  - [literal](https://thabo-ambrose.medium.com/what-is-a-literal-in-computer-programming-560eace90b5b)
    - A literal is the idea of expresssing a non-changing value in a computer program's source code.
  - [runtime](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3900549/what-is-runtime)
    - it describes software/instructions that are executed while my program is running.
  - [tuple](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/tuple.htm)
    - A list of items which are:
      - ordered - I can pick an item from its position
      - unchangeable - once I have created a tuple of "x" items, I cannot add or delete any more items. That mean, only "read" and never "write" into it liao.
  - [instance](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16325/instance)
    - I have a blueprint of a thing. I know that this blueprint represents something but is not the thing itself; so I cannot touch, I cannot use it, I just know what it will look like. It is an abstract thing. When I build it, I need make an _instance_ of that thing. Now I can touch it, use it and give a nickname to it. It become something concrete.
  - [declaration](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/23969/declaration)
    - A declaration in programming (also known as instantiation) is a type of programming statement that notifies the compiler that the programmer is causing a variable (or object) to come into existence.
      - There are three parts to a declaration statement: 
        - the statement gives a unique name to the variable or object being declared
        - the statement also declares the type of the variable or object
        - the statement can optionally initialize the variable or object.
  - [initializing](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/initialize/)
    - the assignment of an initial value for a data object or variable.
    - [Difference between instantiating, declaring, and initializing](https://stackhowto.com/difference-between-instantiating-declaring-and-initializing/)
  - [What is the difference between an Object Literal and an Instance Object in JavaScript ?](https://blog.kevinchisholm.com/javascript/difference-between-object-literal-and-instance-object/)
  - [What is the difference between JSON and Object Literal Notation?](https://www.pimanti.com/what-is-the-difference-between-json-and-object-literal-notation/)
  - [properties](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/properti.htm)
  - [type aliases](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/aliases/)
    - A alternative name for the existing types or newly created types.
  - [string literal](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/typescript-string-literal-types)
    - let me use string as type

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Try to code with lesser research and reference, embrace learning through failures, next 4 week to train myself yellow duck methods.
- Code with think aloud methods.
- Time Management
  - Where is the balance between learn, work, life and rest.
- Slow typing speed
  - How to speed up typing speed?
- Reading speed
  - Comprehended the logic but not the code.
- Memory skills
  - What causing me to lose my memory?
- "Make it Better" <== my personal workflow
  - learn to throw away code and start over again will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub.
- Logic & analytical thinking:
  - I should find a way to think in logical frames to solve problems.
  - important to have strong logical and analytical thinking  capabilities to decide which language or piece of code best suited for each user story.
- Detail-oriented:
  - how to ensure the precise accuracy in writing pieces of code?
  - important to have strong attention to detail to protect my work, remain efficient and prevent bugs.
- Creativity:
  - learn to recognize the potential for technological solutions to everyday problems.
  - important to understand how React Native + TypeScript works, the more creative ways to solve potential problems.
- Resourcefulness + independence:
  - able to complete individual tasks and later combine them together with other.
  - important to remain resourceful and to have confidence in my own ability to find a solution to any coding problem that might arise.
- Curiosity:
  - important to remain curious about coding and various languages and technologies.
- Time-boxing to strict 90 minutes per task with a 20min rest break.

- Day 47 ==> Continue to work on React Native + TypeScript exercise project to practice concepts, its feature, workflows and how to enhance it with material UI CSS fundamentals.

- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.

- Required improvement on technical writing of learning experience and daily lesson task reviews with a better layout.

- Read 1 chapter / 30min of Computational Thinking.

- add one more column for non-technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- try to practice these 9 principles for 52 weeks:
  1. Understand the Basics;
  2. Write Easy To Understand And Logical Programming Codes
  3. Try Analyzing my Code
  4. Read As Many Books I Can
  5. Talking to a fellow programmer
  6. Help others In Solving Their Problems
  7. Contribution to Open Source and Signing-up mailing lists
  8. Practice It Many Times As Possible
  9. Participate In Different Events

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

==============================================================================

## MY GOAL for May
