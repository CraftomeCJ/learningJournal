# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 21:
FIND LOST or MISPLACED ITEMS:
  You know all things; 
  You know where MY CAREER Path is, and you now reveal to me where it is. 
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Detachment: **"This too, will pass!"** <br/>
Recognize the fact of impermanence. <br/>
Allow myself and others the freedom to be who they are. Do not force solutions -- allow solutions to spontaneously emerge <br/>
Uncertainty is essential, and my path to freedom. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Detachment into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. Today I will commit myself to detachment. I will allow myself and those around me the freedom to be as they are. I will not rigidly impose my idea of how things should be. I will not force solutions on problems, thereby creating new problems. I will participate in everything with detached involvement.
  2. Today I will factor in uncertainty as an essential ingredient of my experience. In my willingness to accept uncertainty, solutions will spontaneously emerge out of the problem, out of the confusion, disorder, and chaos. The more uncertain things seem to be, the more secure I will feel, because uncertainty is my path to freedom. Through the wisdom of uncertainty, I will find my security. 
  3. I will step into the field of all possibilities and anticipate the excitement that can occur when I remain open to an infinity of choices. When I step into the field of all possibilities. I will experience all the fun, adventure, magic, and mystery of life. -->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Detect Their True Motives<br/>
DOn't be fool by appearances, by what happens, by people do and say. Always ask: Cui bono? <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man always said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Well-being is realized by small steps, but is truly no small thing." - Zeno <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful to:** be welcomed and accepted by strangers. <br/>

<!-- what has holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Core Traits of a **"SOCIALLY INTELLIGENT PERSON"**: <br/>
They recognize that their "shadow selves" are the traits, behaviors, and patterns that aggravate them about others. <br/>
One's hatred of a misinformed politician could be a projection of their fear of being unintelligent or underqualified. <br/>One's intense dislike for a particularly passive friend could be an identification of one's own inclination to give others power in their life. <br/>It is not always an obvious connection, but when there is a strong emotional response involved, it is always there. If you genuinely dislike something, you would simply disengage with it. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When would this work?
- Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [x] What am I doing to reduce and prevent stress? <br/>
- [x] Do I think I'm doing something of value with my life? Why or why not? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

<!-- learn stop trying to prove myself right
  - ask myself how I can make this better?
  - actively look for where I am wrong? -->
<!-- learn "the code works" isn't where I stop; it's where I start!!
  - step 1 ==> always write quality code that fulfils the spec
  - step 2 ==> Now, make it better!!
    1. Is it valuable to make it faster?
    2. easier to document?
    3. more reusable?
    4. more reliable? -->
<!-- learn write it THREE times
  - First time ==> write the software to prove myself that the solution is possible;
  - Second time ==> make it work
  - Third time ==> make it work right
  - throw away code and start over will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub. -->
<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

<!-- Strategies that help me to push through beginner phase:
  - I will continue to make programs from scratch
    - start writing my own code, without instruction
    - start with an empty file, and type every line of code myself
    - look at other people's code
    - Analyse other people's code
    - learn a little bit about how it works, then write it myself
  - I will start small, very small
    - make something that would be useful in real life
    - start with load of make text-based games, time tracker, to-do list, or something to automate calculations
    - use these projects to learn all of the features of JavaScript, React, and TypeScript
  - write lots of code
    - I have to make software to gain skill
    - The program I make will not do much, and it will probably have messy code, but that doesn't matter
    - read some theory, get some advice, and make a new program
    - each program I make should be bigger and better than the last
    - Repeat these steps for long enough, and I will become an expert
  - ask for help
    - it's OK to ask for help only if I do these:
      - always try to google my problem first
      - analyse the answer and learn the cause behind my error
      - this way, when I encounter the same error again, I will already know how to fix it
    - If I constantly hitting unsolvable problems, that probably means that my project is too ambitious
    - Scale it back, and make something smaller until my skills improve
  - asking help the right way
    - **paste in my exact error message**
      - this is the most important piece of information
    - if there is no error message, **explain what I expected to happen, and what actually happened**
      - something like "I expect it to output 5, but it actually outputs 7"
      - Often, the problem isn't in my code, it's in my expectations
      - If I don't explain what I expected, I will get answers like "the code looks fine" and "what is the problem?"
    - **paste in my broken code**
      - It's very difficult to debug a problem without seeing the code
      - paste it all in, if it's not too big, because people will run my code to investigate the problem
      - If there is too much code, paste it into a Github Gist or Pastebin.com, then put the link into my question
    - **format my code correctly**
      - don't just paste in my code like normal text
      - learn how to format my code nicely so it is easy to read

```python
# It should look like this:

def foobar
  puts 1 + 2 / 3
end
```

```python
# Not like this:

def foobar
puts 1+2/3
end
```

- **mention what I have already tried**
  - this tells people that I've already put in some effort.

- **try to use correct terminology**
  - make an effort to learn the common terms, and use them correctly.

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to my Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 54 (Friday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday will be learning and researching upcoming project tech stack. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
- **Fundamental**
  - [The five basic elements](https://study.com/academy/lesson/5-basic-elements-of-programming.html), in programming are:
    - **Input**: getting data and commands into the computer
    - **Output**: getting your results out of the computer
    - **Variables and data structures**: storing information, which may change over time
    - **Mathematical operations (arithmetic)**: Performing mathematical calculations on your data
    - **Looping and conditionals**: testing to see if a condition is true of false, and cycling through a set of instructions until some condition is met

  - [Computer Programming - Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_basics.htm)

  - [Naming Conventions](https://unional.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/pages/default/draft/naming-conventions.html)
    - Single letter names
      - Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming.
    - Name casing
      - Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances. eslint: camelCase jscs: requireCamelCaseOrUpperCaseIdentifiers
      - Use PascalCase when naming constructors or classes. eslint: new-cap jscs: requireCapitalizedConstructors
      - Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function's name.
      - Use PascalCase when you export a singleton / function library / bare object.
    - Name prefixes
      - Use a leading underscore _ when naming private properties. eslint: no-underscore-dangle jscs: disallowDanglingUnderscores
    - this reference
      - Don't save references to this. Use arrow functions or Function#bind. jscs: disallowNodeTypes
    - File naming
      - If your file exports a single class, your filename should be exactly the name of the class.

- **What am I Learning/Working on now?**

- **TOPIC**
- I want to learn Docker & how to:
  - Build and run an image as a container
  - Share images using Docker Hub
  - Deploy Docker applications using multiple containers with a database
  - Running applications using Docker Compose

- learn about the best practices for building images, including instructions on how to scan your images for security vulnerabilities

- **CONCEPTS**
- What is Docker?
- Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud
- is a software platform that simplifies the process of building, running, managing and distributing applications
- it does this by virtualizing the operating system of the computer on which it is installed and running

## Exercise of the Day

- **Docker Sample Application**

[x] **Challenge:** Read ==> docker docs (aim to build a simple todo list manager)

- Let's work with a simple todo list manager that is running in Node.js
- Let's building an app to prove out my MVP (minimum viable product)
![Todo List Manager](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/images/todo-list-sample.png)

- **Get the app**
  - Before I can run the application, I need to get the application source code onto our machine, let's clone the [repo](https://github.com/docker/getting-started/tree/master/app) and open the project.
  - I should see the package.json and two subdirectories (src and spec).

- **Build the app's container image**
  - to build app we need to use a **Dockerfile**
  - **Dockerfile** is simply a text-based script of instructions that is used to create a container image

- **step 1**
- Create a file named **Dockerfile** in the same folder as the file package.json with the following contents:

```dockerfile
# @filename: ./app/Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM node:12-alpine
RUN apk add --no-cache python2 g++ make
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN yarn install --production
CMD ['node', 'src/index.js']
EXPOSE 3000
```

- Please check that the file Dockerfile has no file extension like .txt
- Some editors may append this file extension automatically and this would result in an error in the next step

- **step 2**
- open a terminal and go to the app directory with the _Dockerfile_
- now build the container image using the docker build command

```bash
# @filename: ./getting-started/app/Dockerfile

docker build -t getting-started .

# This command used the Dockerfile to build a new container image
```

```bash

Use 'docker scan' to run Snyk tests against images to find vulnerabilities and learn how to fix them

# Noticed that a lot of "layers" were downloaded.
# This is because we instructed the builder that we wanted to start from the node:12-alpine image.
# But, since we didn't have that on our machine, that image needed to be downloaded.

# After the image was downloaded, we copied in our application and used yarn to install our application's dependencies.
# The CMD directive specifies the default command to run when starting a container from this image.

# Finally, the -t flag tags our image.
# Think of this simply as a human-readable name for the final image.
# Since we named the image 'getting-started', we can refer to that image when we run a container.

# The . at the end of the docker build command tells that Docker should look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.
```

- **step 3**
- **Start an app container**
  - now I have an image, let's run the application
  - use _docker run_ command to run the application
  - start my container using docker run and specify the name of the image I just created

```bash
docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started

# Without the port mapping, we wouldn't be able to access the application
```

- After a few seconds, open your web browser to http://localhost:3000
- I should see our app
- try add an item or two and see that it works as I expect
- I can mark items as complete and remove items
- now my frontend is successfully storing items in the backend

- At this point, I should have a running todo list manager with a few items. Next, let's make a few changes and learn about managing our containers
- [take a quick look at the Docker Dashboard, I should see two containers running now](https://i.imgur.com/soxM4ws.png)

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

=============================================================================

- **CONCEPTS: Update the application**
  - Let's say to change the "empty text" when we don't have any todo list items.
  - I would like to change it to the following:
    - _You have no todo items yet! Add one above!_

- **step 1**
- **Update the source code**
  - Let's make the change:

```javascript
// @filename: ./app/src/static/js/app.js
 - <p className="text-center">No items yet! Add one above!</p>
 + <p className="text-center">You have no todo items yet! Add one above!</p>
 ```

- **step 2**
- now let's build our updated version of the image, using the same command we used before.

 ```bash
 docker build -t getting-started .
 ```

- **step 3**
- let's start a new container using the updated code

 ```bash
 docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started

# Uh oh! some error!!!
eddce7b0051db17ff11b4faf5cecc539cb163aace9e87896627415a4d5fe3491
docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint intelligent_golick (19c0a4fb21e206f2041d5cf42636abed859da13f9b40f6d217a9f03951f44b18): Bind for 0.0.0.0:3000 failed: port is already allocated.

# so what happened? 
# We aren't able to start the new container because our old container is still running. It is because the container is using the host's port 3000 and only one process on the machine (containers included) can listen to a specific port

# To fix this, we need to remove the old container.
```

- **step 4**
- **Replace the old container**
  - to remove a container, it first needs to be stopped
  - once it has stopped, it can be removed
  - I have two ways to remove the old container

- Way 1: Remove a container using the CLI

```bash
# Get the ID of the container by using the docker ps command.
 docker ps

# Use the docker stop command to stop the container with <the-container-id>

#  Swap out <the-container-id> with the ID from docker ps
 docker stop <the-container-id>

# Once the container has stopped, you can remove it by using the docker rm command.
 docker rm <the-container-id>

# I can stop and remove a container in a single command by adding the "force" flag to the docker rm command. 
# For example: docker rm -f <the-container-id>
 ```

- Way 2: The GUI way..
  - Remove a container using the Docker Dashboard
  - open the Docker dashboard, to remove a container with two clicks!
    - With the dashboard, hover over the app container and I'll see a collection of action buttons appear on the right.
    - Click on the trash can
    - delete the container.
    - Confirm removal and I'm done!
![docker dashboard example](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/images/dashboard-removing-container.png)

- **step 5**
- **Start to updated app container**
  - Let's start the updated app

```bash
docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting started
```

- refresh my browser on http://localhost:3000 and I should see my updated help text
- [updated todo list manager help text](https://i.imgur.com/2n3FQbi.png)

- **Summary**
- Let's recap:
- WhileI am able to build an update, there were two things happened:
  - All of the existing items in the todo list are gone
  - There were a lot of steps involved for such a small change
  - Let's see how to code an updates without needing to rebuild and start a new container every time I make a change

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

=============================================================================

- **CONCEPTS: Persist the DB**
  - Notice that the todo list is being wiped clean every single time I relaunch the container
  - Why is this?
  - Let's fins out how the container is working..

  - **The container's filesystem**
    - When a container runs, it uses the various layers from an image for its filesystem
    - Each container also gets its own "scratch space" to create/update/remove files
    - Any changes won't be seen in another container, even if they are using the same image

- **Container volumes**
  - each container starts from the image definition each time it starts
  - while containers can create, update, and delete files, those changes are lost when the container is removed and all changes are isolated to that container
  - with volumes, I can change all of this
- **Volumes** provide the ability to connect specific filesystem paths of the container back to the host machine
  - If a directory in the container is mounted, changes in that directory are also seen on the host machine
  - If I mount that same directory across container restarts, I will see the same files

- There are two main types of volumes:
  - Let's take a look of named volumes

- **Persist the todo data**
  - By default, the todo app stores its data in a SQLite Database at /etc/todos/todo.db in the container's filesystem
  - What is SQLite?
    - It's a relational database in which all of the data is stored in a single file
    - While this isn't the best for large-scale applications, it works for small demos
  - With the database being a single file, if I can persist that file on the host and make it available to the next container, it should be able to pick up where the last one left off
  - By creating a volume and attaching (often called "mounting") it to the directory the data is stored in, I can persist the data
  - As our container writes to the todo.db file, it will be persisted to the host in the volume
  - As mentioned, I'm going to use a _named volume_
  - Think of a named volume as simply a bucket of data
  - Docker maintains the physical location on the disk and I only need to remember the name of the volume
  - Every time I use the volume, Docker will make sure the correct data is provided

  1. Create a volume by using the _docker volume create_ command

```bash
 docker volume create todo-db
```

  2. Stop and remove the todo app container once again in the Dashboard (or with docker rm -f <id>), as it is still running without using the persistent volume.
  3. Start the todo app container, but add the -v flag to specify a volume mount
    - Use the named volume and mount it to /etc/todos, which will capture all files created at the path.

```bash
docker run -dp 3000:3000 -v todo-db:/etc/todos getting-started
```

  4. Once the container starts up, open the app and add a few items to your todo list
  ![add few items](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/images/items-added.png)
  5. Stop and remove the container for the todo app
    - Use the Dashboard or docker ps to get the ID and then docker rm -f <id> to remove it.
  6. Start a new container using the same command from above.
  7. Open the app. You should see your items still in your list!
  8. Go ahead and remove the container when I've done checking out my list

- _While named volumes and bind mounts are the two main types of volumes supported by a default Docker engine installation, there are many volume driver plugins available to support NFS, SFTP, NetApp, and more! This will be especially important once I start running containers on multiple hosts in a clustered environment with Swarm, Kubernetes, etc._

- **Dive into the volume**
  - So "Where is Docker actually storing my data when I use a named volume?" I can use the _docker volume inspect_ command to find out

```bash
docker volume inspect todo-db
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2022-05-29T16:47:36Z",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": {},
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/todo-db/_data",
        "Name": "todo-db",
        "Options": {},
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]

# The "Mountpoint" is the actual location on the disk where the data is stored
# Note that on most machines, I will need to have root access to access this directory from the host
# But, that's where it is!
```

- **Recap**
  - Now I have a functioning application that can survive restarts!
  - Let's find a better way to make changes without rebuilding images for every change

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

=============================================================================

- **CONCEPTS: Use bind mounts**
  - _Named volumes_ are great if I simply want to store data, as I don't have to worry about where the data is stored
  - With **bind mounts**, I control the exact mountpoint on the host
  - I can use this to persist data, but it's often used to provide additional data into containers
  - When working on an application, I can use a bind mount to mount our source code into the container to let it see code changes, respond, and let me see the changes right away
- For Node-based applications, [nodemon](https://npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is a great tool to watch for file changes and then restart the application
- There are equivalent tools in most other languages and frameworks

- [Quick volume type comparisons](https://i.imgur.com/EAVFO6J.png)

- **Start a dev-mode container**
  - To run our container to support a development workflow, I will do the following:
    - Mount our source code into the container
    - Install all dependencies, including the "dev" dependencies
    - Start nodemon to watch for filesystem changes
- So, let's do it!
  1. Make sure I don't have any previous getting-started containers running
  2. Run the following command from the app directory

```bash
docker run -dp 3000:3000 \
     -w /app -v "$(pwd):/app" \
     node:12-alpine \
     sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev"
```

  3. I can watch the logs using _docker logs_

```bash
docker logs -f <container-id>

nodemon src/index.js
[nodemon] 2.0.13
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node src/index.js`
Using sqlite database at /etc/todos/todo.db
Listening on port 3000

# When I'm done watching the logs, exit out by hitting Ctrl+C
```

4. Now, let's make a change to the app

```javascript
// In the src/static/js/app.js file, let's change the "Add Item" button to simply say "Add"

 - {submitting ? 'Adding...' : 'Add Item'}
 + {submitting ? 'Adding...' : 'Add'}
```

5. Refresh the page (or open it) and I should see the change reflected in the browser almost immediately

- It might take a few seconds for the Node server to restart, so if I get an error, just try refreshing after a few seconds
https://docs.docker.com/get-started/images/updated-add-button.png

6. I can now make any other changes I like, when done, stop the container and build my new image using this command

```bash
docker build -t getting-started .
```

- Using bind mounts is very common for local development setups
- The advantage is that the dev machine doesn't need to have all of the build tools and environments installed
- With a single docker run command, the dev environment is pulled and ready to go

- imagine our project has been selected for future development!
  - In order to prepare for production, I need to migrate the database from working in SQLite to something that can scale a little better
  - For simplicity, I'll keep with a relational database and switch the application to use MySQL
    - But, how should we run MySQL?
    - How do we allow the containers to talk to each other?

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

=============================================================================

- **CONCEPTS: Multi container apps**
  - Up to this point, I have been working with single container apps
  - But, I now want to add MySQL to the application stack
  - The following question arises:
    - Where will MySQL run?
      - Install it in the same container or run it separately?
    - **In general, each container should do one thing and do it well**

- A few reasons:
  - There's a good chance I'd have to scale APIs and front-ends differently than databases
  - Separate containers let me version and update versions in isolation
  - While I may use a container for the database locally, I may want to use a managed service for the database in production
  I don't want to ship my database engine with my app
  - Running multiple processes will require a process manager (the container only starts one process), which adds complexity to container startup/shutdown
  - And there are more reasons
  
- So, we will update our application to work like this:
https://docs.docker.com/get-started/images/multi-app-architecture.png

- **Container networking**
  - Remember that containers, by default, run in isolation and don't know anything about other processes or containers on the same machine
  - So, how do I allow one container to talk to another?
    - The answer is networking
- If two containers are on the same network, they can talk to each other. - If they aren't, they can't

- **Start MYSQL**
  - here are two ways to put a container on a network: 
    1. Assign it at start or
    2. connect an existing container

- For now, I will create the network first and attach the MySQL container at startup

  1. Create the network

```bash
 docker network create todo-app
```

  2. Start a MySQL container and attach it to the network

- I'm also going to define a few environment variables that the database will use to initialize the database (see the "Environment Variables" section in the [MySQL Docker Hub listing](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/))

```bash
docker run -d \
     --network todo-app --network-alias mysql \
     -v todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql \
     -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret \
     -e MYSQL_DATABASE=todos \
     mysql:5.7

# I'm using a volume named todo-mysql-data here and mounting it at /var/lib/mysql, which is where MySQL stores its data
# However, I never ran a docker volume create command
# Docker recognizes I want to use a named volume and creates one automatically for me.
```

  3. To confirm I have the database up and running, connect to the database and verify it connects

```bash
docker exec -it <mysql-container-id> mysql -u root -p

# When the password prompt comes up, type in secret
# In the MySQL shell, list the databases and verify you see the todos database
Enter password:

```

- **Connect to MySQL**
  - Now that I know MySQL is up and running, let's use it! 
  - But, the question is... how?
  - If I run another container on the same network, how do we find the container (remember each container has its own IP address)?
  - To figure it out, I'm going to make use of the **nicolaka/netshoot** container, which ships with a lot of tools that are useful for troubleshooting or debugging networking issues

1. Start a new container using the nicolaka/netshoot image

```bash
# Make sure to connect it to the same network.
docker run -it --network todo-app nicolaka/netshoot
```

2. Inside the container, I'm going to use the _dig_ command, which is a useful DNS tool

```bash
# I going to look up the IP address for the hostname mysql
dig mysql
```

```dockerfile
# and I'll get an output like this...

; <<>> DiG 9.16.28 <<>> mysql

# What this means is... our app only simply needs to connect to a host named mysql and it'll talk to the database!
```

- **Run your app with MySQL**
  - The todo app supports the setting of a few environment variables to specify MySQL connection settings
  - They are:
    - MYSQL_HOST - the hostname for the running MySQL server
    - MYSQL_USER - the username to use for the connection
    - MYSQL_PASSWORD - the password to use for the connection
    - MYSQL_DB - the database to use once connected

- Setting Connection Settings via Env Vars
  - While using env vars to set connection settings is generally ok for development, it is HIGHLY DISCOURAGED when running applications in production
  - A more secure mechanism is to use the secret support provided by your container orchestration framework
    - In most cases, these secrets are mounted as files in the running container
    - I'll see many apps (including the MySQL image and the todo app) also support env vars with a _FILE suffix to point to a file containing the variable
  - As an example, setting the MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE var will cause the app to use the contents of the referenced file as the connection password
    - Docker doesn't do anything to support these env vars
    - My app will need to know to look for the variable and get the file contents

- With all of that explained, let's start our dev-ready container!

1. For MySQL versions 8.0 and higher, make sure to include the following commands in _mysql_

```bash
mysql> ALTER USER 'root' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'secret';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> flush privileges;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

2. Let's specify each of the environment variables above, as well as connect the container to our app network

```bash
   docker run -dp 3000:3000 \
   -w /app -v "$(pwd):/app" \
   --network todo-app \
   -e MYSQL_HOST=mysql \
   -e MYSQL_USER=root \
   -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret \
   -e MYSQL_DB=todos \
   node:12-alpine \
   sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev"
```

3. Look at the logs for the container (docker logs <container-id>), I should see a message indicating it's using the mysql database

```bash
docker logs <container-id>

nodemon src/index.js
[nodemon] 2.0.13

Waiting for mysql:3306.
Connected!

Listening on port 3000
```

4. Open the app in my browser and add a few items to the todo list

5. Connect to the mysql database and prove that the items are being written to the database. Remember, the password is _secret_.

```bash
docker exec -it <mysql-container-id> mysql -p todos

# in the mysql shell, run the following:
mysql> select * from todo_items;

```

-**Recap**

- At this point, I have an application that now stores its data in an external database running in a separate container
  - I learned a little bit about container networking and saw how service discovery can be performed using DNS
  - I should know by now with everything to do to start up a application
  - I have to create a network, start containers, specify all of the environment variables, expose ports, and more

  - **Docker Engine**
    - is one of the core components of Docker
    - it is responsible for the overall functioning of the Docker platform
    - it is a client-server based application and consists of 3 main components
      - Server
      - REST API
      - Client
  - **Docker daemon**
    - aka (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes
    - a daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services
  - **Docker client**
    - aka (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker
    - When I use commands such as docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd, which carries them out
    - The docker command uses the Docker API
    - The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon aka helper
  - **Docker Desktop**
    - It is an easy-to-install GUI for your Mac or Windows environment that enables mE to build and share containerized applications and microservices
    - It includes the Docker daemon (dockerd), the Docker client (docker), Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper
  - **Docker registries**
    - A registry that stores Docker images
    - Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use
    - and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default
    - I can even run my own private registry
    - When I use the docker pull or docker run commands, the required images are pulled from my configured registry
    - When I use the docker push command, my image is pushed to my configured registry
  - **Docker objects**
    - When I use Docker, I'm creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects
  - **Docker Image**
    - is a read-only template that contains the application, and all the dependencies required to run that application on Docker
    - is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container
    - often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization
    - For example:
      - I may build an image which is based on the ubuntu image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run
      - I might create my own images or only use those created by others and published in a registry
      - To build my own image, I create a Dockerfile with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it
      - Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image
      - When I change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed are rebuilt
      - This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies
  - **Docker Containers**
    - is a logical entity
    - it is a running instance of the Docker Image
    - I can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the DockerAPI or CLI
    - it can be run on local machines, virtual machines or deployed to the cloud
    - is portable (can be run on any OS)
    - they are isolated from each other and run their own software, binaries, and configurations
    - it can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state
    - it is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it
    - when a container is removed, any changes to its state that are not stored in persistent storage disappear
  - **Docker Dashboard**
    - gives me a quick view of the containers running on my machine
    - The Docker Dashboard is available for Mac and Windows
    - It gives me quick access to container logs, lets me get a shell inside the container, and lets me easily manage container lifecycle (stop, remove, etc.)
  - **Docker ID**
    - A Docker ID allows me to access Docker Hub which is the world's largest library and community for container images
    - [How a Docker Dashboard looks like](https://i.imgur.com/zkRkG1R.png)

To access the dashboard, follow the instructions in the Docker Desktop manual.

- **JARGON in laymen terms:**
  - [daemons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing))
    - "Daemon" aka "helper" 
    - A daemon is a process (program) that runs in the background on a multi-tasking operating system
    - This means that it is detached from a terminal and runs continuously in a non-interactive mode
    - I can create a daemon by forking a child process and then exiting the parent, which will cause it to be orphaned (on purpose) and adopted by the init process, the grand father of all processes in the system, (which is also a daemon itself)
    - It is then left to run, waiting silently in the background until it is asked to do something
  - [API](https://www.guru99.com/what-is-api.html)
    - Application Programming Interface (API) is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user intervention
    - It is a list of commands as well as the format of those commands that one program can send to another
    - It is used so that individual programs can communicate with one another directly and use each other's functions
    - For example:
      - At a restaurant I have a _menu_, it represents all the different foods that I can order
      - I _placed an order_ with the waiter and he returns with your choice of _Food_
        - Menu = API
        - Placing an Order = Executing an API Call
        - Food = the System's Response
  - [chroot](https://www.journaldev.com/38044/chroot-command-in-linux)
    - The chroot Linux utility can modify the working root directory for a process, limiting access to the rest of the file system

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Try to code with lesser research and reference, embrace learning through failures, next 4 week to train myself yellow duck methods.
- Code with think aloud methods.
- Time Management
  - Where is the balance between learn, work, life and rest.
- Slow typing speed
  - How to speed up typing speed?
- Reading speed
  - Comprehended the logic but not the code.
- Memory skills

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->
