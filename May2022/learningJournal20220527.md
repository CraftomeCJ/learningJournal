# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 21:
FIND LOST or MISPLACED ITEMS:
  You know all things; 
  You know where MY CAREER Path is, and you now reveal to me where it is. 
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Detachment: **"This too, will pass!"** <br/>
Recognize the fact of impermanence. <br/>
Allow myself and others the freedom to be who they are. Do not force solutions -- allow solutions to spontaneously emerge <br/>
Uncertainty is essential, and my path to freedom. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Detachment into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. Today I will commit myself to detachment. I will allow myself and those around me the freedom to be as they are. I will not rigidly impose my idea of how things should be. I will not force solutions on problems, thereby creating new problems. I will participate in everything with detached involvement.
  2. Today I will factor in uncertainty as an essential ingredient of my experience. In my willingness to accept uncertainty, solutions will spontaneously emerge out of the problem, out of the confusion, disorder, and chaos. The more uncertain things seem to be, the more secure I will feel, because uncertainty is my path to freedom. Through the wisdom of uncertainty, I will find my security. 
  3. I will step into the field of all possibilities and anticipate the excitement that can occur when I remain open to an infinity of choices. When I step into the field of all possibilities. I will experience all the fun, adventure, magic, and mystery of life. -->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Detect Their True Motives<br/>
DOn't be fool by appearances, by what happens, by people do and say. Always ask: Cui bono? <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man always said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Well-being is realized by small steps, but is truly no small thing." - Zeno <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful to:** be welcomed and accepted by strangers. <br/>

<!-- what has holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Core Traits of a **"SOCIALLY INTELLIGENT PERSON"**: <br/>
They recognize that their "shadow selves" are the traits, behaviors, and patterns that aggravate them about others. <br/>
One's hatred of a misinformed politician could be a projection of their fear of being unintelligent or underqualified. <br/>One's intense dislike for a particularly passive friend could be an identification of one's own inclination to give others power in their life. <br/>It is not always an obvious connection, but when there is a strong emotional response involved, it is always there. If you genuinely dislike something, you would simply disengage with it. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When would this work?
- Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [x] What am I doing to reduce and prevent stress? <br/>
- [x] Do I think I'm doing something of value with my life? Why or why not? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

<!-- learn stop trying to prove myself right
  - ask myself how I can make this better?
  - actively look for where I am wrong? -->
<!-- learn "the code works" isn't where I stop; it's where I start!!
  - step 1 ==> always write quality code that fulfils the spec
  - step 2 ==> Now, make it better!!
    1. Is it valuable to make it faster?
    2. easier to document?
    3. more reusable?
    4. more reliable? -->
<!-- learn write it THREE times
  - First time ==> write the software to prove myself that the solution is possible;
  - Second time ==> make it work
  - Third time ==> make it work right
  - throw away code and start over will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub. -->
<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

<!-- Strategies that help me to push through beginner phase:
  - I will continue to make programs from scratch
    - start writing my own code, without instruction
    - start with an empty file, and type every line of code myself
    - look at other people's code
    - Analyse other people's code
    - learn a little bit about how it works, then write it myself
  - I will start small, very small
    - make something that would be useful in real life
    - start with load of make text-based games, time tracker, to-do list, or something to automate calculations
    - use these projects to learn all of the features of JavaScript, React, and TypeScript
  - write lots of code
    - I have to make software to gain skill
    - The program I make will not do much, and it will probably have messy code, but that doesn't matter
    - read some theory, get some advice, and make a new program
    - each program I make should be bigger and better than the last
    - Repeat these steps for long enough, and I will become an expert
  - ask for help
    - it's OK to ask for help only if I do these:
      - always try to google my problem first
      - analyse the answer and learn the cause behind my error
      - this way, when I encounter the same error again, I will already know how to fix it
    - If I constantly hitting unsolvable problems, that probably means that my project is too ambitious
    - Scale it back, and make something smaller until my skills improve
  - asking help the right way
    - **paste in my exact error message**
      - this is the most important piece of information
    - if there is no error message, **explain what I expected to happen, and what actually happened**
      - something like "I expect it to output 5, but it actually outputs 7"
      - Often, the problem isn't in my code, it's in my expectations
      - If I don't explain what I expected, I will get answers like "the code looks fine" and "what is the problem?"
    - **paste in my broken code**
      - It's very difficult to debug a problem without seeing the code
      - paste it all in, if it's not too big, because people will run my code to investigate the problem
      - If there is too much code, paste it into a Github Gist or Pastebin.com, then put the link into my question
    - **format my code correctly**
      - don't just paste in my code like normal text
      - learn how to format my code nicely so it is easy to read

```python
# It should look like this:

def foobar
  puts 1 + 2 / 3
end
```

```python
# Not like this:

def foobar
puts 1+2/3
end
```

- **mention what I have already tried**
  - this tells people that I've already put in some effort.

- **try to use correct terminology**
  - make an effort to learn the common terms, and use them correctly.

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to my Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 54 (Friday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday will be learning and researching upcoming project tech stack. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
- **Fundamental**
  - [The five basic elements](https://study.com/academy/lesson/5-basic-elements-of-programming.html), in programming are:
    - **Input**: getting data and commands into the computer
    - **Output**: getting your results out of the computer
    - **Variables and data structures**: storing information, which may change over time
    - **Mathematical operations (arithmetic)**: Performing mathematical calculations on your data
    - **Looping and conditionals**: testing to see if a condition is true of false, and cycling through a set of instructions until some condition is met

  - [Computer Programming - Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_basics.htm)

  - [Naming Conventions](https://unional.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/pages/default/draft/naming-conventions.html)
    - Single letter names
      - Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming.
    - Name casing
      - Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances. eslint: camelCase jscs: requireCamelCaseOrUpperCaseIdentifiers
      - Use PascalCase when naming constructors or classes. eslint: new-cap jscs: requireCapitalizedConstructors
      - Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function's name.
      - Use PascalCase when you export a singleton / function library / bare object.
    - Name prefixes
      - Use a leading underscore _ when naming private properties. eslint: no-underscore-dangle jscs: disallowDanglingUnderscores
    - this reference
      - Don't save references to this. Use arrow functions or Function#bind. jscs: disallowNodeTypes
    - File naming
      - If your file exports a single class, your filename should be exactly the name of the class.

- **What am I Learning/Working on now?**

- **TOPIC**
- I want to learn Docker & how to:
  - Build and run an image as a container
  - Share images using Docker Hub
  - Deploy Docker applications using multiple containers with a database
  - Running applications using Docker Compose

- learn about the best practices for building images, including instructions on how to scan your images for security vulnerabilities

- **CONCEPTS**
- What is Docker?
- Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.
- is a software platform that simplifies the process of building, running, managing and distributing applications. It does this by virtualizing the operating system of the computer on which it is installed and running.

- Let's work with a simple todo list manager that is running in Node.js. Let's building an app to prove out my MVP (minimum viable product)
![Todo List Manager](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/images/todo-list-sample.png)

- **Build the app's container image**
  - to build app we need to use a **Dockerfile**
  - **Dockerfile** is simply a text-based script of instructions that is used to create a container image

- Please check that the file Dockerfile has no file extension like .txt
- Some editors may append this file extension automatically and this would result in an error in the next step

```bash
# open a terminal and go to the app directory with the Dockerfile. Now build the container image using the docker build command
# @filename: ./getting-started/app/Dockerfile

docker build -t getting-started .

# This command used the Dockerfile to build a new container image
```

```bash

Use 'docker scan' to run Snyk tests against images to find vulnerabilities and learn how to fix them

# Noticed that a lot of "layers" were downloaded.
# This is because we instructed the builder that we wanted to start from the node:12-alpine image.
# But, since we didn't have that on our machine, that image needed to be downloaded.

# After the image was downloaded, we copied in our application and used yarn to install our application's dependencies.
# The CMD directive specifies the default command to run when starting a container from this image.

# Finally, the -t flag tags our image.
# Think of this simply as a human-readable name for the final image.
# Since we named the image 'getting-started', we can refer to that image when we run a container.

# The . at the end of the docker build command tells that Docker should look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.
```

- **Start an app container**
  - use _docker run_ command to run the application
  - start my container using docker run and specify the name of the image I just created

```bash
docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started

# Without the port mapping, we wouldn't be able to access the application
```

- After a few seconds, open your web browser to http://localhost:3000. You should see our app

- Go ahead and add an item or two and see that it works as you expect. You can mark items as complete and remove items. Your frontend is successfully storing items in the backend. Pretty quick and easy, huh?

- **Update the application**
  - Let's say to change the "empty text" when we don't have any todo list items. 
  - I would like to change it to the following:
- You have no todo items yet! Add one above!

- **Update the source code**

```javascript
// @filename: src/static/js/app.js
 -                <p className="text-center">No items yet! Add one above!</p>
 +                <p className="text-center">You have no todo items yet! Add one above!</p>
 ```

 ```bash
# Let's build our updated version of the image, using the same command we used before.

 docker build -t getting-started .
 ```

 ```bash
#to start a new container using the updated code.

 docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started

# Uh oh! some error!!!
eddce7b0051db17ff11b4faf5cecc539cb163aace9e87896627415a4d5fe3491
docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint intelligent_golick (19c0a4fb21e206f2041d5cf42636abed859da13f9b40f6d217a9f03951f44b18): Bind for 0.0.0.0:3000 failed: port is already allocated.

# what happened? 
# We aren't able to start the new container because our old container is still running. It is because the container is using the host's port 3000 and only one process on the machine (containers included) can listen to a specific port.

# To fix this, we need to remove the old container.
```

- **Replace the old container**
  - To remove a container, it first needs to be stopped
  - Once it has stopped, it can be removed. We have two ways that we can remove the old container

```bash
# Way 1: Remove a container using the CLI
# Get the ID of the container by using the docker ps command.

 docker ps

# Use the docker stop command to stop the container.

#  Swap out <the-container-id> with the ID from docker ps
 docker stop <the-container-id>

# Once the container has stopped, you can remove it by using the docker rm command.

 docker rm <the-container-id>

# also can stop and remove a container in a single command by adding the "force" flag to the docker rm command. 
# For example: docker rm -f <the-container-id>
 ```

- way 2:
  - Remove a container using the Docker Dashboard
  - open the Docker dashboard, to remove a container with two clicks!
    - With the dashboard, hover over the app container and I'll see a collection of action buttons appear on the right.
    - Click on the trash can
    - delete the container.
    - Confirm removal and you're done!

- **Start to updated app container**
  - Let's start the update app

```bash
docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting started
```

- refresh my browser on http://localhost:3000 and I should see my updated help text

- **Summary**
- Recap
- While we were able to build an update, there were two things you might have noticed:
  - All of the existing items in our todo list are gone
  - There were a lot of steps involved for such a small change.
  - In an upcoming section, Let's talk about how to see code updates without needing to rebuild and start a new container every time we make a change

- **docker -flags References**
- [-d] to run container in detached mode (in the background)
- [-p 80:80] to map port 80 of the host to port 80 in the container
- [docker/getting-started] the image to use
- [-t] to flag tags our image
- [.] to tell docker should look for the Dockerfile in the current directory
- [-f]  "force" flag

- **docker Terminology in laymen terms:**
  - Docker Image
    - is a template that contains the application, and all the dependencies required to run that application on Docker
  - Docker Containers
    - is a logical entity
    - It is a running instance of the Docker Image
    - I can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the DockerAPI or CLI
    - can be run on local machines, virtual machines or deployed to the cloud
    - is portable (can be run on any OS)
    - Containers are isolated from each other and run their own software, binaries, and configurations
  - [chroot](https://www.journaldev.com/38044/chroot-command-in-linux)
    - The chroot Linux utility can modify the working root directory for a process, limiting access to the rest of the file system.

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Try to code with lesser research and reference, embrace learning through failures, next 4 week to train myself yellow duck methods.
- Code with think aloud methods.
- Time Management
  - Where is the balance between learn, work, life and rest.
- Slow typing speed
  - How to speed up typing speed?
- Reading speed
  - Comprehended the logic but not the code.
- Memory skills

  - important to remain resourceful and to habe confidence in my own ability to find a solution to any coding problem that might arise.
- Curiosity:
  - important to remain curious about coding and various languages and technologies.
- Time-boxing to strict 90 minutes per task with a 20min rest break.

- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.

- Required improvement on technical writing of learning experience and daily lesson task reviews with a better layout.

- Read 1 chapter / 30min of Computational Thinking.

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->
