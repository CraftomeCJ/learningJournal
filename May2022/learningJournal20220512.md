# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 19:
SELL MY SKILLS or OTHER ABILITIES:
  Infinite spirit attracts to me the EMPLOYERs for my unique talents who want it and prosper in it. 
  These EMPLOYERs are being sent to me by the creative spirit of my subconscious mind, which makes no mistakes. 
  They may look at many other employees, but mine is the only one they want and will hire, because they are guided by the infinite spirit within them. 
  I know the EMPLOYER is right, the time is right, and the price is right. Everything about it is right. 
  The deeper currents of my subconscious mind are now in operation bringing us together in divine order. 
  I know that it is so.
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Intention and Desire: **"Make a list of desires"**<br/>
Inherent in every intention and desire is the mechanics for its fulfillment. <br/>
Trust that when things don't seem to go my way, there is a reason. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Intention and Desire into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. I will make a list of all my desires. I will carry this list with me whenever I go. I will look at it before I go to sleep at night. I will look at it when I wake up in the morning. 
  2. I will release this list of my desires and surrender it to the womb of creation, trusting that when things don't seem to go my way, there is a reason, and that the cosmic plan has designs for me much grander than even those I have conceived.
  3. I will remind myself to practice present-moment awareness in all my actions. I will refuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate the quality of the attention in the present moment. I will accept the present as it is, and manifest the future through my deepest, most cherished intentions and desires.-->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Look at Their Past <br/>
When choosing people to work and associate with, do not be hypnotized by their reputation or taken in by the surface image they try to project. <br/>
Instead, train myself to look deeper within them, to their past actions, to see their character. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"So many of our dreams at first seem impossible. Then they seem improbable. And then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable." - Christopher Reeve <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful:** to have healthy meals every day. <br/>

<!-- what is holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Things "Emotionally Intelligent People" **DO NOT DO**: <br/>
They DO NOT assume that the way they think and feel about a situation is the way it is in reality, nor how it will turn out in the end. <br/>
They recognize their emotions as responses, not accurate gauges, of what is going on. They accept that those responses may have to do with their own issues, rather than the objective situation at hand. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When or Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [] True or false: It takes a lot to knock me down. <br/>
- [] What am I more afraid of? Failure, or the regret of not trying? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:

2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

    3. more reusable?
    4. more reliable? -->
<!-- learn write it THREE times

  - throw away code and start over will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub. -->
<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to my Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 39 (Thursday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today and Friday will be working on Udemy's restaurant project. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->

### Software Installed

[EXPO CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-cli)

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

=============================================================================

[Day 19: React Native Restaurant App](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ORNCdknTltMnjBT9kYS7be3WTNDc6PXMe0r93LIa5JE/edit#heading=h.sjc7nb6il2di)

### Build a 'Restaurant Search App'

- Objective:
  - An application that going to prompt a user with a search bar at the top of the screen.
  - USer can search for some kind of restaurant, once we get result from some search API, we going to display a series of restaurant on the screen. 
  - Each list is going to be different categories of restaurant that we first. We going to present some cheap option then a little bit pricier and finally to really high tier restaurants down at the bottom.
  - Each of these different section are going to scroll horizontally allow user can scroll left to right to see a list of cheap restaurrant to moderate then expensive restaurant.
  - user can tap on restaurant to take them to a detail page where we show them some image from the restaurant.

- Important Note About Project Generation
  - notes on cli to use
    - **We will be using the expo-cli to generate our project. To ensure that we don't accidentally mix Yarn and npm in our project, add the --npm flag:**

```Bash
npx expo-cli init food --npm
```

- Project Generation
  - [scaffolding](https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-does-scaffolding-in-programming-mean?share=1) projects
    - **File Structure**:
      1. Show three different view elements with the given layout
      2. Set the 'height' and 'width' properties of the view elements, otherwise they will collapse and be invisible
      3. Try to get that green element into its position using two different techniques
      4. Wire Frame

### Restaurant Search App Work Flow

- **With React Native + TypeScript Source Code**

- **[Step 1 Assembling a Navigator](https://i.imgur.com/zvdj32E.png)**
  - making use of react navigation creating stack
  - [Hello React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/hello-react-navigation)
- [Assembling a Navigator... yesss... it's working](https://i.imgur.com/WqoGyp3.png)

```TypeScript
// step 1
// Assembling a Navigator
//@filename: App.tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';

import SearchScreen from './screens/SearchScreen'

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();

function MyStack() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
    <Stack.Navigator>
      <Stack.Screen 
      name="Search" 
      component={SearchScreen} 
      options={{ title: 'Food Street' }}/>
    </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}

export default MyStack;
```

```TypeScript
// @filename: src/screens/SearchScreen.tsx
import { 
  View, 
  Text, 
  StyleSheet 
  } from 'react-native';
  import React from 'react';

const SearchScreen = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>
      Search Screen
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default SearchScreen;

const styles = StyleSheet.create({});
```

- File Structuring

```Bash
# make a new src folder
mkdir src
# move screen to src folder
mv screens src
#  make a component folder
mkdir components
#  add a SearchBar.tsx file
touch components/SearchBar.tsx
```

- Create the search page and result page
  - **Step 2 Starting the Search Bar**
    - matching styles to UI vision
    - [starting the search bar result ugly but it works lol](https://i.imgur.com/aKyjDIU.png)

```typescript
// step 2 Starting the Search Bar
// @filename: components/Searchbar.tsx
import { 
  StyleSheet, 
  TextInput, 
  View } from 'react-native';
import React from 'react';
// step 3 Displaying Icons
import Icon from "react-native-vector-icons/MaterialIcons";

const SearchBar = () => {

  return ( 
    // step 2b add some background styles to the searchbar
    <View style={styles.backgroundStyle}>

    // step 3 Displaying Icons & 3a style the icons
      <Icon name="search" style={styles.iconStyle} />

// step 4 add textInput and use textInput 'prop' styling to the searchbar with 4a custom styling 
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Search"
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default SearchBar

// step 2b, 
// step 4 Search Bar Styling to match UI vision
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  backgroundStyle: {
    marginTop: 10,
    backgroundColor: '#F0EEEE',
    height: 50,
    borderRadius: 5,
    marginHorizontal: 15,
    flexDirection: 'row'
  },
  inputStyle: {  //step 4a textInput styling`
    flex: 1,
    fontSize: 18
  },
  iconStyle: {  // step 3a style the icons
    fontSize: 35,
    alignSelf: 'center',
    marginHorizontal: 15
  }
});
```

```Bash
# "@types/react-native-vector-icons"
npm install --save @types/react-native-vector-icons
```

- **step 3 Displaying Icons**
  - showing icons with MaterialIcons
    - Steps to make use of the react-native-vector-icons for search icon:
      1. Add "[@types/react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react-native-vector-icons)": "^6.4.10", To devDependencies Of the package.jason 
      2. import Icon from "react-native-vector-icons/MaterialIcons"; at SearchBar.tsx component
      - [How to use MaterialIcons in react-native-vector-icons](https://www.tabnine.com/code/javascript/classes/react-native-vector-icons/MaterialIcons)
      - [react-native-vector-icons/glyphmaps/MaterialIcons.json](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons/blob/master/glyphmaps/MaterialIcons.json)

The result screen should be similar to [this](https://i.imgur.com/rlCs8SH.png):

```TypeScript
// @filename: src/screens/SearchScreen.tsx
import {
  View,
  Text,
  StyleSheet
} from 'react-native';
import React from 'react';

// step 2a import the searchbar component here
import SearchBar from '../components/SearchBar'

const SearchScreen: React.FC = () => {

    return (
      <View>

- **Yelp API Workarounds**
In the upcoming lecture, we will be signing up for a Yelp developer account. Depending on your location, some students may be blocked from creating an account. There are a few things you can try.

[Students noted a workaround in this thread using their phone which will show a captcha:](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/learn/lecture/15707036#questions/8334522)

Using a VPN for registration and making API calls should also work. Students mentioned they were able to successfully sign up for an API key using the Opera Browser's built-in VPN feature. Other students mentioned that they were able to use Tunnelbear's free tier.

Lastly, you can try just using my key:

Jw0oIMgpId1HV8x-mogAapr36SVRDSAM00qOEvAmLyxCaOV1I0T6kzJbSvazjA6Q7sNS46uHfHzRzLLAESkHYv3ES50h-sUQwtwvh836OsN-D5UwO6ObMswyxDM6YXYx

Note - If some students try to use this in production or abuse the key in some way, you will start getting 429 errors (too many requests). There is a strict 5000 call per day quota - please only use this key for this course and to complete this project.

=============================================================================

- **React Navigation Fix**
I will be installing the React Navigation library to use in FoodStreet project. Please read the following important information and updated installation instructions:

- **Important Message about React Navigation v5**
This project will be using the v4 version of React Navigation and not the v5 version. To date, this code still works as expected. <br/>
The v4 version is still important to know and understand as it is used widely in existing codebases in many organizations. <br/>
I highly encourage you to fully understand how React Navigation works. <br/>
As a self-study opportunity to attempt a migration of my finished working projects to [React Navigation v5](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/upgrading-from-4.x/.)

1. React Navigation v4 Installation
note: I cannot mix Yarn and npm in the same project as it will break your dependencies. I must consistently use the same package manager. If I have yarn installed on my computer it will be used by default to generate the project. In this case, I must use Yarn to install your dependencies.

1. Install React Navigation

npm install react-navigation --legacy-peer-deps

or

yarn add react-navigation

2. Install Dependencies

expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view

3. Install React Navigation Stack

npm install react-navigation-stack @react-native-community/masked-view --legacy-peer-deps

or

yarn add react-navigation-stack @react-native-community/masked-view

4. Start the app and clear cache with expo r -c

note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
