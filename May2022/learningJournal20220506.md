# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 1:
CLEANSE MY MIND
  Divine love fills my soul.
  Divine right action is mine.
  Divine harmony governs my life.
  Divine peace fills my soul.
  Divine beauty is mine.
  Divine joy fills my soul.
  I am divinely guided in all ways.
  I am illumined from on High.
  I know and believe that I will receive a measure of life, love, truth, and beauty that transcends my boldest dreams.
  I know that universal love and generosity embrace me. 
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Detachment: **"This too, will pass!"** <br/>
Recognize the fact of impermanence. <br/>
Allow myself and others the freedom to be who they are. Do not force solutions -- allow solutions to spontaneously emerge <br/>
Uncertainty is essential, and my path to freedom. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Detachment into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. Today I will commit myself to detachment. I will allow myself and those around me the freedom to be as they are. I will not rigidly impose my idea of how things should be. I will not force solutions on problems, thereby creating new problems. I will participate in everything with detached involvement.
  2. Today I will factor in uncertainty as an essential ingredient of my experience. In my willingness to accept uncertainty, solutions will spontaneously emerge out of the problem, out of the confusion, disorder, and chaos. The more uncertain things seem to be, the more secure I will feel, because uncertainty is my path to freedom. Through the wisdom of uncertainty, I will find my security. 
  3. I will step into the field of all possibilities and anticipate the excitement that can occur when I remain open to an infinity of choices. When I step into the field of all possibilities. I will experience all the fun, adventure, magic, and mystery of life. -->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
See Through the False Front <br/>
Never take appearances for reality. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Discipline is choosing between what you want now and what you want most." - some wise man said so

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful for:** allow myself to appreciate the prosperity and abundance that comes my way today.

<!-- what is holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
The Psychology of DAILY ROUTINE: <br/>
As my body self-regulates, routine becomes the pathway to "flow". <br/>
"Flow" is essentially what happens when I become so completely engaged with what I'm doing, all ideas or worries dissolve, and I'm just completely present in the task. <br/>
The more I train my body to respond to different cues: <br/>
7am is when I wake up; 11am is when I start coding; 3pm is when I start coffee break, and so on, <br/>
I naturally fall into flow with a lot more ease, just out of habit. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When or Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions of the day?**

- [] Today, I can choose to be without prejudice, to act with justice, to keep an even level, to be in control of myself -- even when that means dedication and sacrifice. If that's not beautiful, what is? <br/>
- [] If I gave myself a surprise three day paid break to rest and recuperate, what would I do with those three days? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->
## **To be 1% better than yesterday!!**

<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to my Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->
1. [Completed a personal React native + Typescript Mini Guide documentations Ver 1.1](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/RNTraining-REMAKE/blob/main/src/Learning_TypeScript_RN/README.md)
2. dinner with wife @7.30pm

## Personal Notes

**Day 33 (Friday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday continue working on React Native + TypeScript App with simple "hello world" program to make sure it works, and slowly build up "BentoApp" and learn and add dependencies one by one, debug error line by line if any. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace. Be ready to fail.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
[Setup TypeScript with React](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/setup/#vs-code-extensions)

[A beginner’s guide to Metro Bundler](https://medium.com/geekculture/a-beginners-guide-to-metro-bundler-f639d641468b)

- npx is actually using command from the project's modeule
- npm is using the command from the global module
**--save-dev vs --save**
- --save-dev 
  - ==> saves to devDependencies only present in development environment.
- --save 
  - ==> saves to dependencies which will be present in development + built releases
- some packages that we should use in devDependencies are @types packages.
    - ==> as they store the typing of the package used only in development.
- when we build for release, the typescript project is compiled to javascript, which makes the @types packages useless, hence, those are always in devDependency

# Be careful when you are defining a global git ignore rule. This is because the rules in a global .gitignore are set by default across all projects.
# A global .gitignore file is best used for common files like .env which you will almost never want to commit to a git repository.

## Exercise of the Day

[x] **Challenge:** Build a BentoApp

- Objective:
  - Displaying splash screen during response time from the server is an excellent way to interact with the user. But making a loading/splash screen becomes difficult when we want to practically use an animated loader, where we need to make extra efforts to write down its styling file. To overcome this problem, we use a bunch of predefined loaders from the react-spinners module.

1. File Structure:
   1. src directory (source of components)
      - assets directory (for images & other resources)
      - welcome/splashscreen directory (SplashScreen)
      - screens directory (for loginScreen & registerScreen [UI/UX])
      - drawerscreens directory (for HomeScreen & SettingScreen)
      - to add dashboard directory (dashboard)
   2. Wire Frame
![file structure1](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/IMG/PNG/learningImgs/file1.png "style=width:200 height: 200")
![file structure2](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/IMG/PNG/learningImgs/file2.png "style=width:200 height: 200")
<h4 align="center">Project Logo</h4>
![project logo](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/IMG/GIF/bentoLogo.gif "style=width:50 height: 50")

1. Approach:
  Step 1: write some code in App.tsx, no need to make any other components for this project. For using the predefined spinners we need to import the 'loader' component from 'react-spinners'.
  Step 2: need to 'useState" to add a state to our functional component and 'useEffect' is also needed.

      - Put your side-effect logic into the callback function, then use the dependencies argument to control when you want the side-effect to run. That's the sole purpose of useEffect().
      - ![useEffect() Hook](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/IMG/PNG/learningImgs/file3.png "style=width:200 height: 200")
      - [A Simple Explanation of React.useEffect()](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-useeffect-explanation/#1-useeffect-is-for-side-effects)
      - [What is useState() in React ?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-usestate-in-react/)
      - [useState and useEffect explained](https://medium.com/recraftrelic/usestate-and-useeffect-explained-cdb5dc252baf)

  Step 3 ==> Add a state isLoading which will indicate that splashscreen page is loading or not.
  Step 4 ==> Add a setTimeout() method inside useEffect to make the splash screen appear for a certain time period example: 5sec.
      Step 5 ==> use a custom CSS block to override its property and use it when isLoading is true example: page is still loading.
3. Git Branch

   1. main
    - setup folder & file
    - merge safe dependencies from branch 'testing'
   2. testing
      - test npm dependencies installed
      - playground for ideas
      - merge to branch 'main/splashscreen/loginscreen/ once error free
   3. SplashScreen
      - build splashscreen
   4. LoginScreen
      - build loginscreen

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->
