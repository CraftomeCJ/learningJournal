# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- 
Week 1: "Take some time to quiet my mind and remind myself that I were created to be joyous"
==> CLEANSE MY MIND
  Divine love fills my soul.
  Divine right action is mine.
  Divine harmony governs my life.
  Divine peace fills my soul.
  Divine beauty is mine.
  Divine joy fills my soul.
  I am divinely guided in all ways.
  I am illumined from on High.
  I know and believe that I will receive a measure of life, love, truth, and beauty that transcends my boldest dreams.
  I know that universal love and generosity embrace me.
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Giving: **Give, thou shalt Receive** <br/>
Today, bring whomever I encounter a gift: a smile, a compliment or flower.<br/>
Gratefully receive gifts. Keep wealth circulating by giving and receiving care, affection, appreciation and love</br>

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Take on the Toxic Types <br/>
Come to appreciate these encounter as a chance to hone my skills of self-mastery. <br/>
Outsmarting just one of these types will give me a great deal of confidence that I can handle the worst in human nature. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"If you find yourself constantly trying to prove your worth to someone, you have already forgotten your value " - Some wise man saying..

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm grateful for:** my coffee which reminds me that it can be the small things that create the most joy.

<!-- what is holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
The Psychology of DAILY ROUTINE: <br/>
<br/>
Happiness is not how many things I do, but how well I do them. <br/>
<br/>
More is not better. Happiness is not experiencing something else; <br/>
it's continually experiencing what I already have in new and different ways. <br/>
Unfortunately as I'm taught that passion should drive our every thought move and decision, I'm basically impaled with the fear that I'm unhappy because I'm not doing "ENOUGH". <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When or Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions of the day?**

- Ask myself if today I'm grateful for the choices I made several years ago, or if I wish that in the past I had been more concerned about my future. <br/>
  - [] Are the choices I am making today ==> choices that are only benefiting the present "me", but don't contribute to -- or worse, jeopardize -- my well-being in the future?

==============================================================================

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->
## **To be 1% better than yesterday!!**

<!--learn To identify my three highest-leverage activities in my work, 
first => make a list ==> capture all of the tasks I'm responsible for in my job od a typical month. 
second ask myself => if I could only do one thing on that list all day long, ==> which item on the list would add the most value to my company?
Third ask myself => the same question ==> If I could do only one more thing on your list of key tasks, which would be the second activity that contributes the most value to my company?
last ask myself again ==> ask yourself what the third most important task is.-->

==============================================================================

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to my Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 29 (Monday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today will be working on Day 17 manipulating the UI to my design practice and prep for tomorrow Day 18 making a UI Login page

==============================================================================

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Had make good progress on practice to time-boxing my task to 90 minutes per self-assigned task.

- Continue to work on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it with some CSS fundamentals.

- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.

- Day 26 is continue to learn and practice on Day 15 & 16 notes of React Native concepts and at the same time work on TypeScript conversion, behind schedule by 2.5 days.

- Practice more to have better understanding of the useState & useReducer with other tutorials.

- Layout of working journal now look good, from day 26 onwards will improve on technical writing of learning experience and daily lesson task reviews with a better layout.

- Add one more column for technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- add one more column for non-technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- To learn and master better file management on using .gif to showcase course's challenge work and .png folder for error and warning messages display.

==============================================================================

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

==============================================================================
