# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 19:
SELL MY SKILLS or OTHER ABILITIES:
  Infinite spirit attracts to me the EMPLOYERs for my unique talents who want it and prosper in it. 
  These EMPLOYERs are being sent to me by the creative spirit of my subconscious mind, which makes no mistakes. 
  They may look at many other employees, but mine is the only one they want and will hire, because they are guided by the infinite spirit within them. 
  I know the EMPLOYER is right, the time is right, and the price is right. Everything about it is right. 
  The deeper currents of my subconscious mind are now in operation bringing us together in divine order. 
  I know that it is so.
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Dharma: **"Purpose in Life"** <br/>
Seek my higher "SELF". Discover my unique talents. Ask myself how I am best suited to serve humanity. <br/>
Using my unique talents and serving others bring unlimited bliss and abundance. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Dharma into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. Today I will lovingly nurture the god and goddess in embryo that lies deep within my soul. I will pay attention to the spirit within me that animated both my body and my mind. I will awaken myself to this deep stillness within my heart. I will carry the consciousness of timeless, eternal Being in the midst of time-bound experience. 
  2. I will make a list of my unique talents. Then I will list all the things that I love to do while expressing my unique talents. When I express my unique talents and use them in the service of humanity, i lose track of time and create abundance in my life as well as in the lives of others. 
  3. I will ask myself daily, "How can I serve?" and "How can I help?" The answers to these questions will allow me to help and serve my fellow human beings with love. -->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
The Grandiose Leader<br/>
A simple fact about grandiose leaders: they depend on the attention they are given. DO not feed their egos by giving them what they crave. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"What would life be if we had no courage to
attempt anything?" - Vincent van Gogh <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm grateful for:** all the goodness of God. . <br/>

<!-- what is holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Things "Emotionally Intelligent People" **DO NOT DO**: <br/>
They recognize that infallible composure is not emotional intelligence. <br/>
They DO NOT withhold their feelings or try to temper them so much as to render them almost gone. <br/> They do, however, have the capacity to withhold their emotional response until they are in an environment wherein it would be appropriate to express how they are feeling. <br/>
They DO NOT suppress it; they manage it effectively. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When or Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [] How can I help? How can I help all those that I come in contact with? <br/>
- [] What brings me joy? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->

<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

- **step 16 Grouping Results**
  - [Grouping Logic](https://i.imgur.com/hwkUlU0.png)

```TypeScript

const SearchScreen: React.FC = () => {

    const [term, setTerm] = useState<string>('');
    const { results, searchApi, errorMessage } = useResults();

  // step 16a add console.log(results) to see what is inside the result variable
  // console.log(results);

  // step 16b then create a helper function call filterResultByPrice
  const filterResultByPrice = (price: string) => {
    // price === '$' || price === '$$' || price === '$$$'

  <ResultList results={filterResultByPrice('$$')} title="Bit Pricier" />
  <ResultList results={filterResultByPrice('$$$')} title="Big Spender" />

// step 16d to receive new Props 'results' here
const ResultList = ( {title, results}: {title: string, results: string} ) => {
  return (
    <View>

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Try to code with lesser research and reference, embrace learning through failures, next 4 week to train myself yellow duck methods.
- Code with think aloud methods.
- Time Management
  - Where is the balance between learn, work, life and rest.
- Slow typing speed
  - How to speed up typing speed?
- Reading speed
  - Comprehended the logic but not the code.
- Memory skills
  - What causing me to lose my memory?
- "Make it Better" <== my personal workflow
  - learn to throw away code and start over again will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub.
- Logic & analytical thinking:
  - I should find a way to think in logical frames to solve problems.
  - important to have strong logical and analytical thinking  capabilities to decide which language or piece of code best suited for each user story.
- Detail-oriented:
  - how to ensure the precise accuracy in writing pieces of code?
  - important to have strong attention to detail to protect my work, remain efficient and prevent bugs.
- Creativity:
  - learn to recognize the potential for technological solutions to everyday problems.
  - important to understand how React Native + TypeScript works, the more creative ways to solve potential problems.
- Resourcefulness + independence:
  - able to complete individual tasks and later combine them together with other.
  - important to remain resourceful and to habe confidence in my own ability to find a solution to any coding problem that might arise.
- Curiosity:
  - important to remain curious about coding and various languages and technologies.
- Time-boxing to strict 90 minutes per task with a 20min rest break.

- Day 42 ==> Continue to work on React Native + TypeScript exercise project to practice concepts, its feature, workflows and how to enhance it with material UI CSS fundamentals.

- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.

- Required improvement on technical writing of learning experience and daily lesson task reviews with a better layout.

- Read 1 chapter / 30min of Computational Thinking.

- add one more column for non-technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- try to practice these 9 coding principles for 52 weeks:
  1. Understand the Basics;
  2. Write Easy To Understand And Logical Programming Codes
  3. Try Analyzing my Code
  4. Read As Many Books I Can
  5. Talking to a fellow programmer
  6. Help others In Solving Their Problems
  7. Contribution to Open Source and Signing-up mailing lists
  8. Practice It Many Times As Possible
  9. Participate In Different Events

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

==============================================================================

## MY GOAL for May

### Aim to create a personal work flow of writing code from scratch to practice and improve my skills.
