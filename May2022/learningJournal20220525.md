# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 21:
FIND LOST or MISPLACED ITEMS:
  You know all things; 
  You know where MY CAREER Path is, and you now reveal to me where it is. 
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Least Effort: **"Is that so?" Apply the Power of Non-Resistance**<br/>
Shows the good through inner non-resistance. <br/>
Accept people, situations and events as they occur. Take responsibility for my situation and for all events seen as problems. <br/>
Relinquish the need to defend my point of view. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Least Effort into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. I will practice Acceptance. Today I will accept people, situations and events as they occur. I will know that this moment is as it should be, because the whole universe is as it should be. I will not struggle against the whole universe by struggling against this moment. My acceptance is total and complete. I accept things as they are this moment, not as I wish they were.
  2. Having accepted things as they are, I will take Responsibility for my situation and for all those events I see as problems. I know that taking responsibility means not blaming anyone or anything for my situation (and this includes myself). I also know that every problem is an opportunity in disguise, and this alertness to opportunities allows me to take this moment and transform it into a greater benefit.
  3. Today my awareness will remain established in Defenselessness. I will give up the need to defend my point of view. I will feel no need to convince or persuade others to accept my point of view. I will remain open to all view and not be rigidly attached to any one of them.-->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Avoid the Drama Magnet<br/>
It is best to recognize them as early aas possible, before I become enmeshed and dragged down. <br/>
Examine their past for evidence of the pattern and run for the hills if I suspect I am dealing with such a type. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man always said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Joy for human beings lies in proper human work. And proper human work consists in: <br/>acts of kindness to other human beings, disdain for the stirrings of the senses, identifying trustworthy impressions, and contemplating the natural order and all that happens in keeping with it." - Marcus Aurelius <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful to:** grow up and experience life, regardless how tough it may be at times. <br/>

<!-- what has holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Core Traits of a **"SOCIALLY INTELLIGENT PERSON"**: <br/>
They DO NOT try to inform people of their ignorance. <br/>
When I accuse someone of being wrong, I close them off to considering another perspective by heightening their defenses. <br/>
If I first validate their stance ("That's interesting, I never thought of it that way...") and then present my own opinion ("Something I recently learned is this...") <br/> and then let them know that they still hold their own power in the conversation by asking their opinion ("What do you think about that?"), <br/> 

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When would this work?
- Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [x] How do I define the meaning of “joy”? <br/>
- [x] How do I respond to a tough challenge that really tests my limit? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

  - ask myself how I can make this better?
  - actively look for where I am wrong? -->
<!-- learn "the code works" isn't where I stop; it's where I start!!
  - step 1 ==> always write quality code that fulfils the spec
  - step 2 ==> Now, make it better!!
    1. Is it valuable to make it faster?
    2. easier to document?
    3. more reusable?
    4. more reliable? -->
<!-- learn write it THREE times
  - First time ==> write the software to prove myself that the solution is possible;
  - Second time ==> make it work
  - Third time ==> make it work right
  - throw away code and start over will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub. -->
<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to my Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 52 (Wednesday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday will be learning advance state management with useContext to manage global state management, work on a Udemy's Tracker App. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
- **Fundamental**
  - [The five basic elements](https://study.com/academy/lesson/5-basic-elements-of-programming.html), in programming are:
    - Input: getting data and commands into the computer
    - Output: getting your results out of the computer
    - Looping and conditionals: testing to see if a condition is true of false, and cycling through a set of instructions until some condition is met
    - Mathematical operations (arithmetic): Performing mathematical calculations on your data
    - Variables and data structures: storing information, which may change over time

  - [Computer Programming - Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_basics.htm)

  - [Naming Conventions](https://unional.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/pages/default/draft/naming-conventions.html)
    - Single letter names
      - Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming.
    - Name casing
      - Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances. eslint: camelCase jscs: requireCamelCaseOrUpperCaseIdentifiers
      - Use PascalCase when naming constructors or classes. eslint: new-cap jscs: requireCapitalizedConstructors
      - Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function's name.
      - Use PascalCase when you export a singleton / function library / bare object.
    - Name prefixes
      - Use a leading underscore _ when naming private properties. eslint: no-underscore-dangle jscs: disallowDanglingUnderscores
    - this reference
      - Don't save references to this. Use arrow functions or Function#bind. jscs: disallowNodeTypes
    - File naming
      - If your file exports a single class, your filename should be exactly the name of the class.

- **tsconfig.tools.json file JARGON in laymen terms with references:**
- [extends](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#extends)
  - The value of extends is a string which contains a path to another configuration file to inherit from
  - The path may use Node.js style resolution
  - The configuration from the base file are loaded first, then overridden by those in the inheriting config file
  - All relative paths found in the configuration file will be resolved relative to the configuration file they originated in

- [outDir](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#outDir)
  - Params: (<path>)
  - Summary:
    - Where should outputted/transpiled FILES go
  - When To Use:
    - When I want to dictate where outputted FILES go and not leave the default value which is in the same directory as the source code

- [types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#types)
  - By default all visible "@types" packages are included in I compilation
  - Packages in node_modules/@types of any enclosing folder are considered visible
  - For example, that means packages within ./node_modules/@types/, ../node_modules/@types/, ../../node_modules/@types/, and so on.
- If types is specified, only packages listed will be included in the global scope

- [importHelpers](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#importHelpers)
  - Params: (true | false)
  - Summary:
    - Will replace inline helper function implementations for things like async/await and Object spread operator {...obj} that are otherwise redefined and injected into each file with the respective function call from the centralized tslib library
  - When To Use:
    - When I want to reduce my file size by making my outputted JS more DRY and have helpers that are otherwise injected into each file come from a centralized lib
  
- [FILES](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#FILES)
  - Specifies an allowlist of FILES to include in the program
  - An error occurs if any of the FILES can't be found.

- [references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#references)
  - Project references are a way to structure my TypeScript programs into smaller pieces
  - Using Project References can greatly improve build and editor interaction times, enforce logical separation between components, and organize my code in new and improved ways.
- I can read more about how references works in the [Project References](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) section of the handbook

- [jsx](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#jsx)
  - Controls how JSX constructs are emitted in JavaScript FILES
  - This only affects output of JS FILES that started in .tsx FILES.
    - react: Emit .js FILES with JSX changed to the equivalent React.createElement calls
    - **react-jsx**: Emit .js FILES with the JSX changed to _jsx calls
    - react-jsxdev: Emit .js FILES with the JSX changed to _jsx calls
    - preserve: Emit .jsx FILES with the JSX unchanged
    - react-native: Emit .js FILES with the JSX unchanged

- [allowJs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#allowJs)
  - Allow JavaScript FILES to be imported inside I project, instead of just .ts and .tsx FILES

- [esModuleInterop](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#esModuleInterop)
  - With flag esModuleInterop we can import CommonJS modules in compliance with es6 modules spec
  - [Understanding esModuleInterop in tsconfig file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56238356/understanding-esmoduleinterop-in-tsconfig-file)

- [allowSyntheticDefaultImports](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#allowSyntheticDefaultImports)
  - When set to true, allowSyntheticDefaultImports allows I to write an import like:
  - **import React from "react";**
    - instead of: _import * as React from "react";_

- [forceConsistentCasingInFileNames](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#forceConsistentCasingInFileNames)
  - TypeScript follows the case sensitivity rules of the file system it's running on
  - This can be problematic if some developers are working in a case-sensitive file system and others aren't
  - If a file attempts to import fileManager.ts by specifying ./FileManager.ts the file will be found in a case-insensitive file system, but not on a case-sensitive file system
- When this option is set, TypeScript will issue an error if a program tries to include a file by a casing different from the casing on disk

- [strict](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict)
  - The strict flag enables a wide range of type checking behavior that results in stronger guarantees of program correctness
  - Turning this on is equivalent to enabling all of the strict mode family options, which are outlined below
  - I can then turn off individual strict mode family checks as needed.

- [noImplicitOverride](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noImplicitOverride)
  - When working with classes which use inheritance, it's possible for a sub-class to get "out of sync" with the functions it overloads when they are renamed in the base class

- [noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature)
  - This setting ensures consistency between accessing a field via the "dot" (obj.key) syntax, and "indexed" (obj["key"]) and the way which the property is declared in the type

- [noImplicitReturns](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noImplicitReturns)
  - When enabled, TypeScript will check all code paths in a function to ensure they return a value

- [noFallthroughCasesInSwitch](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noFallthroughCasesInSwitch)
  - Report errors for fallthrough cases in switch statements
  - Ensures that any non-empty case inside a switch statement includes either break or return
  - This means I won't accidentally ship a case fallthrough bug.

  - [**/*.d.ts]
    - All FILES with the extension .d.js from here onwards
    - I can use the **, *, and ? wildcard characters to specify a group of FILES as inputs for a build instead of listing each file separately
      - The ? wildcard character matches a single character.
      - The * wildcard character matches zero or more characters.
      - The ** wildcard character sequence matches a partial path.

- **CONCEPTS: Nx project.json**
  - Projects can be configured in [project.json](https://nx.dev/configuration/projectjson#project-configuration) if I use Nx executors
  - Project Configuration
    - The project.json file contains configuration specific to its project
    - This file is often created when I use Nx Plugins
    - It configures custom executors, which are used instead of npm scripts
    - Custom executors are typed, toolable and provide a lot more flexibility for running long-live processes
    - They are also more composable.
- If I'm satisfied with npm scripts though, I will never see a project.json file in my workspace
  - But we encourage to explore Nx Plugins and the power they bring

- **File Location: /home/craftome_cj/Desktop/COMPANY-WORK-SPACE/myLearnerFolder/Blog_App/packages/rn-commons/**

```json
// @filename: ./packages/rn-commons/project.json
{
  "$schema": "../../node_modules/nx/schemas/project-schema.json",
  "sourceRoot": "packages/rn-commons",
  "projectType": "library",
  "tags": [],
  "targets": {
    "lint": {
      "executor": "@nrwl/linter:eslint",
      "outputs": ["{options.outputFile}"],
      "options": {

        "passWithNoTests": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- **project.json file JARGON in laymen terms with references:**
  - [$schema]
    - The $schema keyword
  - [sourceRoot]
    - tells Nx the location of the library's source FILES
  - [projectType]
    - is either 'application' or 'library'
    - The project type is used in project graph viz and in a few aux commands
  - [tags]
    - can annotate your projects with tags
  - [targets]
    - target name
  - [lint]
  - [executor]
    - The executor property tells Nx what function to invoke when you run the target. "@nrwl/jest:jest" tells Nx to find the @nrwl/jest package, find the executor named jest and invoke it with the options
  - [outputs]
    - "outputs": ["dist/libs/mylib"] tells Nx where the build target is going to create file artifacts
    - The provided value is actually the default, so we can omit it in this case. "outputs": [] tells Nx that the test target doesn't create any artifacts on disk.
  - [options]
    - The options provides a map of values that will be passed to the executor. The provided command line args will be merged into this map. I.e., nx test mylib --jestConfig=libs/mylib/another-jest.config.js will pass the following to the executor
  - [lintFilePatterns]
  - [test]
    - target name
    - The name of the target test means that you can invoke it as follows: nx test mylib or nx run mylib:test.
  - [jestConfig]
  - [passWithNoTests](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli#--passwithnotests)
    - allows the test suite to pass when no files are found

  },
  moduleFileExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'js', 'jsx'],
  coverageDirectory: '../../coverage/packages/rn-commons/utilities',
};
```

- **jest.config.ts file JARGON in laymen terms with references:**
  - [displayName](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#displayname-string-object)
    - default: undefined
    - allows for a label to be printed alongside a test while it is running
    - this becomes more useful in multi-project repositories where there can be many jest configuration files
    - this visually tells which project a test belongs to.
  - [preset](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#preset-string)
    - Default: undefined
    - a preset that is used as a base for Jest's configuration
    - a preset should point to an npm module that has a jest-preset.json, jest-preset.js, jest-preset.cjs or jest-preset.mjs file at the root
  - [transform](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transform-objectstring-pathtotransformer--pathtotransformer-object)
    - Default: {"\\.[jt]sx?$": "babel-jest"}
    - a map from regular expressions to paths to transformers
    - a tuple with configuration options can be passed as second argument: {filePattern: ['path-to-transformer', {options}]}
      - for example, here is how you can configure babel-jest for non-default behavior: {'\\.js$': ['babel-jest', {rootMode: 'upward'}]}
    - Jest runs the code of your project as JavaScript, hence a transformer is needed if you use some syntax not supported by Node out of the box (such as JSX, TypeScript, Vue templates)
    - by default, Jest will use babel-jest transformer, which will load your project's Babel configuration and transform any file matching the /\.[jt]sx?$/ RegExp (in other words, any .js, .jsx, .ts or .tsx file)
    - in addition, babel-jest will inject the Babel plugin necessary for mock hoisting talked about in ES Module mocking.
  - [moduleFileExtension](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#modulefileextensions-arraystring)
    - Default: ["js", "mjs", "cjs", "jsx", "ts", "tsx", "json", "node"]
    - an array of file extensions your modules use
    - If I require modules without specifying a file extension, these are the extensions Jest will look for, in left-to-right order.
      - recommend placing the extensions most commonly used in your project on the left, so if you are using TypeScript, you may want to consider moving "ts" and/or "tsx" to the beginning of the array.
  - [coverageDirectory](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#coveragedirectory-string)
    - Default: undefined
    - the directory where Jest should output its coverage files.

    - "warn" or 1 - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn't affect exit code)
    - "error" or 2 - turn the rule on as an error (exit code is 1 when triggered)

## Exercise of the Day

Functional Programming with TypeScript **_Revisited_ Day 1**

[x] **Challenge:** Read ==> Function Programming with TypeScript (aim to understand the main characteristic of functional programming)

## Today's Summary

- Functional Programming concepts:
  - higher-order functions
  - function partial application
  - immutability
  - referential transparency


<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

==============================================================================

## So do I know now?

- **CONCEPTS: Functional Programming Intro**

"OOP makes code understandable by encapsulate moving parts. FP makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts." - Michael Feathers

- Moving Parts
  - mean [state](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/235558/what-is-state-mutable-state-and-immutable-state) changes aka state mutation

- In FP, we try to avoid dealing with state mutations instead of encapsulate them.
- A mutable state is bad, because it makes the behavior of our code harder to predict.

```TypeScript
// let see this example ah:

function isIndexPage() {
  return window.location.pathname === "/";
}

// I declared a function call isIndexPage
// purpose is to check whether the current page is the root page in a wed application based on the current path
// since the path of some data change all the time, I can consider it as a piece of 'state"

// This issue is we may assume that the state never change wor.. since the last known state.. then how???
// Well.. I can solve it by transforming the function into what is known in FP as a "pure function"... music...drum... showtime!!!!
```

- **CONCEPTS: PURE FUNCTIONS**

  - one of the core concepts;
  - A function can be consider pure when it returns a value that is computed using only the arguments passed to it;
  - A pure function avoids changing its arguments or any other external variables;
  - A pure function always returns the same value given the same arguments, solely when it is invoked.

- more on pure functions:
  - A function is called pure when its return value is determined only by its own arguments
  - When given the same argument, the result will always be the same.

```javascript
function twice(num) {
  return num * 2;
}
// If we pass 4 to this function, it will always return 8.
```

- _Key points:_
  - Pure functions provide referential transparency
  - This means that when a pure function is invoked it can be replaced by its own result
  - We can replace twice(4) by 8 without affecting our outcome
  - Pure functions cannot reference variables from their outer scope
  - If any function is doing so then its not a pure function.

```javascript
// NOT a pure function

let num = 8; // can be mutated from anywhere else

function impureTwice() {
  return num * 2;
}
```

- Pure functions cannot call impure functions.
- Pure functions do not produce side effects

```TypeScript
// this example earlier is not pure function because it accesses the pathname variable,
//which has not been passed as an argument to the function:
//let's rewrite it:

function isIndexPage(pathname: string) {
  return pathname === "/";
}

// a basic example wor can understand anot ah???
// now I can easily identify that the newer version is easier to predict.
// Pure function help me to make code easier to understand, maintain and test
```

```typescript
// let's image that I wanted to write a unit test for the impure version of the isIndexPage function
// older version would encounter problem because the function uses the window.location object.
// can be overcome but required more efforts and add a lot complexity to my unit test because my fault lah.. never use pure function loh

// wah.. for newer version different liao loh..
// it is more straightforward like this:
function shouldReturnTrueWhenPathIsIndex() {
  let expected = true;
  let result = isIndexPage("/");
  if (result !== result) {
    throw new Error('Expected ${expected} to equals ${result}');
  }
}

function shouldReturnFalseWhenPathIsNotIndex() {
  let result = false;
  let result = isIndexPage("/someotherpage");
  if (expected !== result) {
    throw new Error('Expected ${expected} to equals ${result}');
  }
}

// how?? can understand bo??
// I now use function programming to help me to write better code by avoiding state mutations aka state changes
// if understand liao.. let's move on to side-effects and referential transparency
```

- **TIP**

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

==============================================================================

## Do you know what is Pure Functions, yes?

- use function programming to help me to write better code by avoiding state mutations aka state changes
- use pure function to return a value that can be computed using only the argument passed to it
- it is common to say FP is a function that has no "side-effects"
  - which means when I run a pure function, I can expect that the function is not going to interfere with my other components in the application

- **CONCEPTS: side-effects**
  -An operation, function or expression is said to have a side effect if it modifies some state variable value outside its local environment
  - When a function or expression modifies state outside its own context, the result is a side effect
  - For example, manipulating the DOM, making an API call, modifying database, creating alerts and dialogs, etc.
  - Any function that has side effects is impure
    - An impure function mutates state outside its scope. 

- This is where TypeScript need to be mentioned, although TS interact fantastically with JavaScript, it still have it downsides, the Type System cannot guarantee that our App is free from side-effects.

```TypeScript
// let make an example how I can use some FP techniques to improve the type safety of my TS App:
// let's write a function that find user age by name

interface                                   // TYPE keyword to describe a type
User                                        // unique what-I-name-it defines a TYPE
{                                           // the curly braces {} is object literal syntax
  ageInMonths: number;                      // to define the shape of objects 
  name: string;                             // with unique what-I-name-it object name
}                                           // with respective type annotation and close with a semi-colon

function                                    // function statement
findUserAgeByName(                          // unique name of what-I-name-it new function => method()
  users: User[],                            // what-I-name-it argument aka params 1 with type Array[]
  name: string                              // what-I-name-it argument aka params 2 with type String
): number                                   // return_type Number, it can be any valid data type

{                                           // do something between the { }
  if                                        // if conditional expression
  (users.length === 0) {                    // condition: (string length of variable users strictly equal to zero)
    throw new Error('There are no users!'); //<--- generates an error object with the message of There are no users!
  }

const                                       // variable keyword
user =                                      // unique what-I-name-it new variable name
users                                       // using what-I-name-it argument in my function
.find                                       // to get value of the first element in the array[] inside function of what-I-name-it argument provided condition [a testing function] is satisfied
(u => u.name === name);                     // a testing function inside the parenthesis for .find() method to use

if                                          // truthy 'if' keyword for if-else conditional is 'true' statement
(!user)                                     // if else (condition) "!" <-- bang mean "not"
{                                           // do something between the { }
  throw                                     // throw statement to throw a defined-by-me exception
   new                                      // creates a new object
    Error                                   // Error() constructor to create an error object
    ('User not found');                     // a what-I-name-it 'reason' why this Promise rejected/resolve/then/catch
}                                           // this step is generating and handling errors
else                                        // falsy 'else' keyword for if-else conditional if statement is 'false'
{
  return                                    // return statement for
  user.ageInMonths;                         // unique what-I-name-it variable name calling unique what-I-name-it TYPE object
}}                                          // closing of return statement & finish do something liao in-between the { }

// In this function hor if returns a 'number' Boss TS is happy no compiles issues.
// The issue is... what if it don't always return a 'number' then how???
//  for example we can use the function as follows:
// it will compile and throw an exception at runtime

// a variable 'user' of an array of object
const users = [
  {ageInMonths: 1, name: 'Tom'},
  {ageInMonths: 2, name: 'Jerry'},
];

// variable userAge1 is as number
const                                     // variable container keyword
userAge1                                  // what-I-name-it variable container name
 =                                        // assign syntax
 findUserAgeByName(users, 'Tom');         // function call
console.log(`Tom is ${userAge1 / 12} years old!`);   // <-- swee swee no errors wor

// variable userAge2 is a number too but the function throws you out wor!!
const userAge2 = findUserAgeByName([], "Jerry");
console.log(`Jerry is ${userAge2 /12} years old!`);   // <-- Boss say "Executed JavaScript Failed:"

// why????
```

```typescript
// Let's see another example, this time we do it another way different from earlier function:
// this time instead of returning a number, we will clearly, openly, without reservation return a "promise"
// the "promise" forces me to use the "handler"
// this "handler" is only called if the "promise" is fulfilled 
// (in other words if the function returns an error, it never try to convert the age to years)

interface User {
  ageInMonths: number;
  name: string;
}

function safeFindUserAgeByName(
  users: User[], 
  name: string
): Promise<number> {
  if (users.length === 0) {
    return Promise.reject(new Error('There are no users!'));
  }

  const user = users.find(u => u.name === name);

  if (!user) {
    return Promise.reject(new Error('User not found!'));
  } else {
    return Promise.resolve(user.ageInMonths);
  }
}

const users = [
  {ageInMonths: 52, name: 'Tom'},
  {ageInMonths: 88, name: 'Jerry'},
];

safeFindUserAgeByName(users, 'Tom') //all good
.then(userAge1 => console.log(`Tom is ${userAge1 /12} years old!`));

safeFindUserAgeByName([], 'Jerry')  //error
.then(userAge1 => console.log(`Jerry is ${userAge1 /12} years old!`));

// The 'Promise' type help me to prevent errors because it expresses potential errors in an explicit way

==============================================================================

- **Programming JARGON in laymen terms:**
  - [pure function](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-a-pure-function-in-javascript)
    - An expression that is not referentially transparent is known as referentially opaque.
    - A pure function is a deterministic function
    - This means when a same input is passed every time, the function will return same output
    - In mathematical terms it is nothing but a well defined function.
    - A pure function will have the following properties:
      - It depends only on its own arguments.
      - It wont try to change variables out of its scope.
      - It doesn't produce any side effects.
  - A **pure function** is a referentially transparent expression.
  - [interface](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/walkthrough-interfaces/)
    - The only job of an interface in TypeScript is to describe a type
    - While class and function deal with implementation, interface helps us keep our programs error-free by providing information about the shape of the data we work with
    - Because the type information is erased from a TypeScript program during compilation, we can freely add type data using interfaces without worrying about the runtime overhead.
    - Rules and Regulation for Function Interface to be taken into consideration while working with the function interface in TypeScript:
      - Function interface should only contain the method signature, not implementation.
      - The interface should be created by using the 'interface' keyword followed by interface name.
      - While creating the object for the interface function, it should refer to the implemented function.
      - While defining the function inside the interface variable type and function return type should be properly mentioned.
      - While giving the implementation for the functional interface method signature should be matched properly otherwise it will not work.
  - [number data type: number](https://www.typescripttutorial.net/typescript-tutorial/typescript-number/)
    - All numbers in TS are either floating-point values or big integers
    - The floating-point numbers have the type number while the big integers get the type bigint.
  - [string data type: string](https://www.typescripttutorial.net/typescript-tutorial/typescript-string/)
    - TS uses double quotes (") or single quotes (') to surround string literals
    - also supports template strings that use the backtick (`) to surround characters
    - The template strings allow you to create multi-line strings and provide the string interpolation features.
  - [function()](https://www.typescripttutorial.net/typescript-tutorial/typescript-functions/)
    - functions are the building blocks of readable, maintainable, and reusable code.
    - Use type annotations for function parameters and return type to keep the calling code inline and ensure the type checking within the function body
  - [array type: Array[]](https://www.typescripttutorial.net/typescript-tutorial/typescript-array-type/)
    - TS array is an ordered list of values
    - An array can store a mixed type of values
    - To declare an array that holds values of a specific type, I use the let arr: type[] syntax.
  - [.length property](https://www.tutorialkart.com/typescript/typescript-string-length/)
    - To returns the length of a String in TS, I can use length property of the String object
    - When I use the length property on the String object, it returns an integer that represents the length of the string
    - The length property of a String object contains the length of the string, in UTF-16 code units
    - .length is a read-only data property of string instances
  - ["throw" expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw)
    - The throw statement throws a user-defined exception
    - Execution of the current function will stop (the statements after throw won't be executed)
    - and control will be passed to the first catch block in the call stack
    - If no catch block exists among caller functions, the program will terminate.
  - ["new" Keyword](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/javascript/what-is-the-new-keyword-in-javascript.html)
    - The [new operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new) let me create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function
    - It creates a new object. The type of this object is simply object
    - It sets this new object's internal, inaccessible, [[prototype]] (i.e. __proto__) property to be the constructor function's external, accessible, prototype object (every function object automatically has a prototype property)
    - It makes the this variable point to the newly created object
    - It executes the constructor function, using the newly created object whenever this is mentioned
    - It returns the newly created object, unless the constructor function returns a non-null object reference
    - In this case, that object reference is returned instead.
  - [Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)
    - Error objects are thrown when runtime errors occur
    - The Error object can also be used as a base object for user-defined exceptions
    - Runtime errors result in new Error objects being created and thrown
  - [Error() constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/Error)
    - The Error constructor creates an error object
  - [new Error() Method](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-new-error-method/)
    - For generating and handling errors
    - The new Error() method is an inbuilt application programming interface in which a new Error object is created and error.message property is set to the provided text message
    - [Difference between throw Error('msg') and throw new Error('msg')](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-throw-errormsg-and-throw-new-errormsg/)
  - [constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor)
    - A class or function that specifies the type of the object instance
    - enables me to provide any custom initialization that must be done before any other methods can be called on an instantiated object.
  - [const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)
    - Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword
    - The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator)
    - and it can't be redeclared (i.e. through a variable declaration)
    - However, if a constant is an object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed
    - [Rules and Regulations for const Keyword](https://www.educba.com/typescript-const/?source=leftnav)
  - [Array find() Method .find()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-array-find-method/)
    - The [arr.find() method](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/js-array-find-method) is used to get the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided condition
    - It checks all the elements of the array and whichever first element satisfies the condition is going to print
    - This function will not work function having the empty array elements, also does not change the original array.
    - The function and syntax of find() is very much like the Array.filter method, except it only returns a single element
    - Another difference is when nothing is found, this method returns a value of undefined
    - So if you only need a single value, use find()! When you need to find/return multiple values, reach for filter() instead
    - Using find() is super easy! The only required parameter of this method is a testing function, and it can be as simple or complex as needed.

```javascript
// most basic form
array.find(testingFunction); // that's it!

// I can use find() to easily search arrays of objects, too!
const users = [
  {ageInMonths: 1, name: 'Tom'},
  {ageInMonths: 2, name: 'Jerry'},
];

  const user = users.find(u => u.name === name);
```

- [return](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/typescript/typescript_returning_function.htm)
  - Functions may return value along with control, back to the caller
  - Such functions are called as returning functions.
  - The return_type can be any valid data type.
  - A returning function must end with a return statement
  - A function can return at the most one value, it means there can be only one return statement per function.
  - The data type of the value returned must match the return type of the function.
  - [Promise return type :promise< > {}](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/typescript-function-return-type-promise)
    - To declare a function with a promise return type, set the return type of the function to a promise right after the function's parameter list
    - If the return type of the function is not set, TS will infer it
    - advantage of setting the return type of the function explicitly is that the type checker would throw an error if you try to return a promise of a different type
  - [handler]
    - In Computer Science, this term is typically used in operating systems and other system software development
    - When used in this context, the term handler could be making reference to a software routine/procedure or event that performs a particular task
    - In some cases, the term handler could also be making reference to a routine that "handles" an exception of some kind, such as an error, but it can refer to mainstream processes as well
  - ["Promises" object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
    - A [promise]((https://blog.fildon.me/asynchronous-programming-in-typescript)) can be one of the three states below.
      - The first state is called the **Pending** state. When a Promise is created, it will be pending
      - The second is called the **Resolved** state, in which the Promise is successfully executed
      - If any error occurs in the Promise, it will move to the third state called **Rejected**
    - [Promise](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-promises/) is used to make asynchronous calls
    - Keep in mind that I can only call from tasks that aren't interdependent. Otherwise, there will be a data inconsistency problem.
    - When using it, I must pass the inner function; otherwise, I'll get an error.
    - [JavaScript Promise Object](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_promise.asp)
      - Benefits of Promises 
        - Improves Code Readability
        - Better handling of asynchronous operations
        - Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic
        - Better Error Handling
    - [TypeScript promise](https://www.educba.com/typescript-promise/)
      - The promise in TypeScript is used to make asynchronous programming to execute several tasks simultaneously
      - The promise can be used when we want to handle multiple tasks at the same time
      - By the use of TypeScript promise, we can skip the current operation and move to the next line of the code
      - Promise provides the feature for asynchronous programming or parallel programming, which allows the number of tasks to be executed simultaneously at the same time.
    - [promise type](https://www.educba.com/typescript-promise-type/)
      - A promise is a JavaScript object which is responsible for handling callbacks and other asynchronous events or data with 2 different possible states
        - it either resolves or rejects.
  - [Promise.reject()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/reject)
    - it is useful to make _reason_ an _instanceof_ **Error**.
    - The Promise.reject(reason) method returns a Promise object that is rejected with a given reason
    - It is used for debugging purposes and selective error catching
      - The catch() method can be used for logging the output of the reject() method to the console that is catch() method acts as a career which carries the rejected message from Promise.reject() method and displays that in user's console
      - **Parameter**: This method accepts a single parameter as mentioned above and described below:
        - **reason**: It is the reason for which the promise is rejected.
      - **Return value**: It returns the rejected promise with the given reason, either specified by user or via the backend.
  - [Promise.resolve()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve)
    - The static Promise.resolve function returns a Promise that is resolved
    - If the value is a promise, that promise is returned;
    - if the value is a thenable (i.e. has a "then" method), the returned promise will "follow" that thenable, adopting its eventual state;
    - otherwise the returned promise will be fulfilled with the value.
    - This function flattens nested layers of promise-like objects (e.g. a promise that resolves to a promise that resolves to something) into a single layer.
  - [reason]
    - Reason why this Promise rejected.
  - [Promise.prototype.then()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then)
    - The .then() method returns a Promise
    - It takes up to two arguments: callback functions for the success and failure cases of the Promise
    - As the .then() and Promise.prototype.catch() methods return promises, they can be chained — an operation called **composition**
  - [Promise.prototype.catch()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/catch)
    - The .catch() method is used for error handling in promise composition
    - Since it returns a Promise, it can be chained in the same way as its sister method, .then()
    - The catch() method returns a Promise and deals with rejected cases only
    - It behaves the same as calling Promise.prototype.then(undefined, onRejected) (in fact, calling obj.catch(onRejected) internally calls obj.then(undefined, onRejected))
    - This means that you have to provide an onRejected function even if you want to fall back to an undefined result value - for example obj.catch(() => {}).

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
