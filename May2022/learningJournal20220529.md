# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 22:
Make an important or Difficult Decision:
  The creative intelligence of my subconscious mind knows what is best for me.
  Its tendency is always life-ward, and it reveals to me the right decision, which blessed all concerned.
  I give thanks for the answer which I know will come to me.
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Pure Potentiality: **"Maybe!" => Illustrate the wisdom of non-judgement**<br/>
Take time to be silent, to just BE. <br/> Meditate for 22 minutes twice per day. <br/>
Silently witness the intelligence within every living thing. Practice non-judgement. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Pure Potentiality into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. I will get in touch with the field of pure potentiality by taking time each day to be silent, to just BE. I will also sit alone in silent meditation at least twice a day for approximately 22 minutes in the morning and 22 minutes in the evening. 
  2. I will take time each day to interact with nature and to silently witness the intelligence within every living thing. I will sit silently and watch a sunset, or listen to the sound of the ocean or a stream, or simply smell the scent of a flower. In the ecstasy of my own silence, and by interacting with nature, I will enjoy the lire throb of ages, the field of pure potentiality and unlimited creativity.
  3. I will practice non-judgement. I will begin my day with this statement: "Today, I shall judge nothing that occurs, and reply "MAYBE!" to all opinion-seeking suggestions by others," and throughout the day I will remind myself not to judge. -->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Nothing Personal<br/>
Judge people by their actions and not taking them personally will free me up, help me keep my emotional balance. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man always said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Work nourishes noble minds." - SENECA, Moral Letters <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful to:** to have a home, which may be one single place or multiple places. <br/>

<!-- what has holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Core Traits of a **"SOCIALLY INTELLIGENT PERSON"**: <br/>
They listen to hear, not respond. <br/>
While listening to other people speak, they focus on what is being said, not how they going to respond. <br/>
This is also known as the meta practice of "holding space". <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When would this work?
- Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [x] What are my own weak points? How do they affect my goals and what can I do to fix those weaknesses, to prevent them from continuing to affect my life in a negative way? <br/>
- [x] What words do I use the most often and how do they reflect me as a person? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

<!-- Coding as a Career -->
<!-- learn remind myself how much I have to learn -->
<!-- learn stop trying to prove myself right
  - ask myself how I can make this better?
  - actively look for where I am wrong? -->
<!-- learn "the code works" isn't where I stop; it's where I start!!
  - step 1 ==> always write quality code that fulfils the spec
  - step 2 ==> Now, make it better!!
    1. Is it valuable to make it faster?
    2. easier to document?
    3. more reusable?
    4. more reliable? -->
<!-- learn write it THREE times
  - First time ==> write the software to prove myself that the solution is possible;
  - Second time ==> make it work
  - Third time ==> make it work right
  - throw away code and start over will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub. -->
<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

<!-- Strategies that help me to push through beginner phase:
  - I will continue to make programs from scratch
    - start writing my own code, without instruction
    - start with an empty file, and type every line of code myself
    - look at other people's code
    - Analyse other people's code
    - learn a little bit about how it works, then write it myself
  - I will start small, very small
    - make something that would be useful in real life
    - start with load of make text-based games, time tracker, to-do list, or something to automate calculations
    - use these projects to learn all of the features of JavaScript, React, and TypeScript
  - write lots of code
    - I have to make software to gain skill
    - The program I make will not do much, and it will probably have messy code, but that doesn't matter
    - read some theory, get some advice, and make a new program
    - each program I make should be bigger and better than the last
    - Repeat these steps for long enough, and I will become an expert
  - ask for help
    - it's OK to ask for help only if I do these:
      - always try to google my problem first
      - analyse the answer and learn the cause behind my error
      - this way, when I encounter the same error again, I will already know how to fix it
    - If I constantly hitting unsolvable problems, that probably means that my project is too ambitious
    - Scale it back, and make something smaller until my skills improve
  - asking help the right way
    - **paste in my exact error message**
      - this is the most important piece of information
    - if there is no error message, **explain what I expected to happen, and what actually happened**
      - something like "I expect it to output 5, but it actually outputs 7"
      - Often, the problem isn't in my code, it's in my expectations
      - If I don't explain what I expected, I will get answers like "the code looks fine" and "what is the problem?"
    - **paste in my broken code**
      - It's very difficult to debug a problem without seeing the code
      - paste it all in, if it's not too big, because people will run my code to investigate the problem
      - If there is too much code, paste it into a Github Gist or Pastebin.com, then put the link into my question
    - **format my code correctly**
      - don't just paste in my code like normal text
      - learn how to format my code nicely so it is easy to read

```python
# It should look like this:

def foobar
  puts 1 + 2 / 3
end
```

```python
# Not like this:

def foobar
puts 1+2/3
end
```

- **mention what I have already tried**
  - this tells people that I've already put in some effort.

- **try to use correct terminology**
  - make an effort to learn the common terms, and use them correctly.

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to my Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 56 (Sunday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday will be learning advance state management with useContext to manage global state management, work on a Udemy's Blog App. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
- **Fundamental**
  - [The five basic elements](https://study.com/academy/lesson/5-basic-elements-of-programming.html), in programming are:
    - **Input**: getting data and commands into the computer
    - **Output**: getting your results out of the computer
    - **Variables and data structures**: storing information, which may change over time
    - **Mathematical operations (arithmetic)**: Performing mathematical calculations on your data
    - **Looping and conditionals**: testing to see if a condition is true of false, and cycling through a set of instructions until some condition is met

  - [Computer Programming - Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_basics.htm)

  - [Naming Conventions](https://unional.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/pages/default/draft/naming-conventions.html)
    - Single letter names
      - Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming.
    - Name casing
      - Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances. eslint: camelCase jscs: requireCamelCaseOrUpperCaseIdentifiers
      - Use PascalCase when naming constructors or classes. eslint: new-cap jscs: requireCapitalizedConstructors
      - Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function's name.
      - Use PascalCase when you export a singleton / function library / bare object.
    - Name prefixes
      - Use a leading underscore _ when naming private properties. eslint: no-underscore-dangle jscs: disallowDanglingUnderscores
    - this reference
      - Don't save references to this. Use arrow functions or Function#bind. jscs: disallowNodeTypes
    - File naming
      - If your file exports a single class, your filename should be exactly the name of the class.

- **step 5: understanding authentication on express API**
  - [Logic](https://i.imgur.com/Bx4AObt.png)

```bash
# 5.1 @filename: ./ProjectFolder/tracker-server/src
mkdir routes
cd routes
touch authRoutes.js
```

```javascript
// 5.2 to write all request handling logic
// @filename: ./src/routes/authRoutes.js

const express = require('express');

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/signup', (req, res) => {
  res.send('You made a post request');
});

module.exports = router;
```

```javascript
// @filename: ./src/index.js
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
// 5.3 import authRoutes here
const authRoutes = require("./routes/authRoutes");

const app = express();

// 5.4 call the component here
app.use(authRoutes);

const mongoUri = 'mongodb+srv://admin:p%4055w0rD@cluster0.cxviw.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority'

mongoose.connect(mongoUri);

mongoose.connection.on("connected", () => {
  console.log("Connected to mongo instance");
});
mongoose.connection.on("error", (err) => {
  console.error("Error connecting to mongo", err);
});

app.get("/", (res) => {
  res.send('yo yo yo!');
});

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log("Listening on port 4000");
});
```

=============================================================================

- **step 7: Handling JSON Data**
  - [Logic](https://i.imgur.com/GYWzbYm.png)

```javascript
// @filename: ./src/index.js
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
// 7.1 import bodyParser module here
// a helper library for automatic parse information associated with body property of incoming request
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const authRoutes = require("./routes/authRoutes");

const app = express();

// 7.2 call the module here
app.use(bodyParser.json());   // sequence is important 
app.use(authRoutes);

const mongoUri = 'mongodb+srv://admin:p%4055w0rD@cluster0.cxviw.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority'

mongoose.connect(mongoUri);

mongoose.connection.on("connected", () => {
  console.log("Connected to mongo instance");
});
mongoose.connection.on("error", (err) => {
  console.error("Error connecting to mongo", err);
});

app.get("/", (res) => {
  res.send('yo yo yo!');
});

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log("Listening on port 4000");
});
```

```javascript
// @filename: ./src/routes/authRoutes.js

const express = require('express');

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/signup', (req, res) => {
  // 7.3 add console.log here
  console.log(req.body);
  res.send('You made a post request');
});

module.exports = router;
```

@Thunder Client New Request
**POST localhost:4000/signup**

- 7.4 write some request in thunder client POST-->Body-->Json
  - {
    "email": "test@test.com",
    "password": "mypassword"
    }
  - [Json](https://i.imgur.com/8yOOVbo.png)
- 7.5 thunder client POST-->Header
  - add Content-Type = application/json
  - [Http Headers](https://i.imgur.com/Y88zvy1.png)
- 7.6 test it out by click _send_ button on thunder client
  - [Result look nice on terminal](https://i.imgur.com/dRCIiP4.png)

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

=============================================================================

- **step 8: Setting up MongoDB, defining a User Schema**
  - [Logic 1](https://i.imgur.com/OnmLoCL.png)
  - [Logic 2](https://i.imgur.com/sxHkvKu.png)

```bash
# 8.1 @filename: ./ProjectFolder/tracker-server/src
mkdir models
cd models
touch User.js
```

```javascript
// @filename: ./src/models/User.js
// 8.2 import mongoose library here
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

// 8.3 define a schema here
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email {
    type: String,
    unique: true,
    required: true
  },
  password {
    type: String,
    required: true
  }
});

// 8.4 call the schema here
mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

```javascript
// @filename: ./src/index.js
// 8.5 require in the user file we just created
require("./models/User");
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const authRoutes = require("./routes/authRoutes");

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(authRoutes);

const mongoUri = 'mongodb+srv://admin:p%4055w0rD@cluster0.cxviw.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority'

mongoose.connect(mongoUri);

mongoose.connection.on("connected", () => {
  console.log("Connected to mongo instance");
});
mongoose.connection.on("error", (err) => {
  console.error("Error connecting to mongo", err);
});

app.get("/", (req, res)=> {
  res.send('yo yo yo!');
});

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log("Listening on port 4000");
});
```

```javascript
// @filename: ./src/routes/authRoutes.js
const express = require('express');

// 8.6 to get a reference to user models we just created we import mongoose here
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// 8.7 to get access
const User = mongoose.model('User');

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/signup', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body);
  res.send('You made a post request');
});

module.exports = router;
```

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

=============================================================================

- **step 9: creating & saving USer**
  - [Logic](https://i.imgur.com/aNoxfKb.png)

```javascript
// @filename: ./src/routes/authRoutes.js
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const User = mongoose.model('User');

const router = express.Router();

// 9.4a use async/await to initial the save operation
router.post('/signup', async (req, res) => {
  // 9.1 do some destructuring here
  const {email, password} = req.body;

  // 9.2 create a new user here
  const user = new User({email, password});

  // 9.3 use the new instance User and call a save on it
//  9.4b await the result
 await user.save();

  res.send('You made a post request');
});

module.exports = router;
```

- 9.5 go to thunder client to create a new user
  - if no error on thunder client & terminal mean i have created a new user successfully
  - to verify that i can go back to mongoDB cluster-->collections
    - i should see [an object](https://i.imgur.com/7eQ3dHT.png) successfully created by me

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

=============================================================================

- **step 10: error handling & password is not store as plain text**
  - [logic](https://i.imgur.com/294z3Qo.png)

- if we try to send the same email & password on thunder client, I will received a big error (MongoServerError: E11000 duplicate key error collection: test.users index: email_1 dup key: { email: "test@test.com" }
) [like this](https://i.imgur.com/ujbBQqJ.png)
- if we remove the email & password in thunder client, I too will receive another big chunk error (ValidationError: User validation failed: email: Path `email` is required., password: Path `password` is required.
) [like this](https://i.imgur.com/ZsUDmsz.png)
- why is that?
  - mongoose unique & required validation are guarding for us

```javascript
// @filename: ./src/routes/authRoutes.js
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const User = mongoose.model('User');

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/signup', async (req, res) => {

  const {email, password} = req.body;

// 10.1 wrap the entire block with try/catch statement
// this block is for signup handling
try {
  const user = new User({email, password});

 await user.save();

  res.send('You made a post request');
  // 10.2 close off with a catch statement

  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(422).send(err.message);
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

- 10.3 let try to send an empty request again on thunder client
  - this time no big chunk of error, it show [this](https://i.imgur.com/O1yArwo.png) (User validation failed: email: Path `email` is required., password: Path
`password` is required.)

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->

  - important to have strong attention to detail to protect my work, remain efficient and prevent bugs.
- Creativity:
  - learn to recognize the potential for technological solutions to everyday problems.
  - important to understand how React Native + TypeScript works, the more creative ways to solve potential problems.
- Resourcefulness + independence:
  - able to complete individual tasks and later combine them together with other.
  - important to remain resourceful and to habe confidence in my own ability to find a solution to any coding problem that might arise.
- Curiosity:
  - important to remain curious about coding and various languages and technologies.
- Time-boxing to strict 90 minutes per task with a 20min rest break.

- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.

- Required improvement on technical writing of learning experience and daily lesson task reviews with a better layout.

- Read 1 chapter / 30min of Computational Thinking.

- add one more column for non-technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- try to practice these 9 principles for 52 weeks:
  1. Understand the Basics;
  2. Write Easy To Understand And Logical Programming Codes
