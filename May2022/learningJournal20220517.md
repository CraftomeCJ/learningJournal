# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 20:
SOLVE A PROBLEM:
  My subconscious knows the answer.
  It is responding to me now. 
  I give thanks because I know the infinite spirit of my subconscious knows all the things and is revealing the perfect answer to me.
  My real conviction is now setting free the majestic and glory of my subconscious mind.
  I rejoice that it is so.
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Karma: **What We Sow is What We Reap**<br/>
Every action generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind. <br/>
Choosing actions that bring happiness and success to others ensures the flow of happiness and success to me.<br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Karma into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. Today I will witness the choices I make each moment. And in the mere witnessing of these choices. I will bring them to my concious awareness. I will know that the best way to prepare for any moment in the future is to be fully conscious in the present.
  2. Whenever I made a choice, I will ask myself two questions:
     1. What are the consequences of this choice that I'm making?
     2. Will this choice bring fulfilment and happiness to me and also to those who are affected by this choice?
  3. I will then ask my heart for guidance and be guided by its message of comfort or discomfort. If the choice feels comfortable, I will plunge ahead with abandon. If the choice feels uncomfortable, I will pause and see the consequences of my action with my inner vision. This guidance will enable me to make spontaneously correct choices for myself and for all those around me. -->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Deciphering the Shadow<br/>
Be eatra wary around people who display emphatic traits. It is very easy to get caught up in the appearance and first impression. <br/>
Watch for the signs and emergence of the opposite over time. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Be plesant until ten o'clock in the morning and the rest of the day will take care of itself." - Elbert Hubbard <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful to:** have an open heart to let people in, and I'm thankful to have a heart that refuses to let those same people go. <br/>

<!-- what is holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Things "Emotionally Intelligent People" **DO NOT DO**: <br/>
They DO NOT confuse a bad feeling for a bad life. <br/>
They are aware of, and avoid extrapolation, which is essentially projecting the present moment into the foreseeable future -- <br/>
believing that the moment at hand constitutes what your entire life amounted to, rather than just being another passing, transitory experience in the whole. <br/> 
Emotionally Intelligent People allow themselves their "bad" days. They let themselves be fully human. It's in this non-resistance that they find the most peace of all. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When or Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [x] When I make choices -- any choice at all -- What are the consequences of this choices that I'm making today? <br/>
- [x] Will this choices that I'm making now bring happiness to me and to those around me? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:

2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

    2. easier to document?
    3. more reusable?
    4. more reliable? -->
<!-- learn write it THREE times

<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 44 (Tuesday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today will be finish up Day 25 & 26 material to read more and practice on building Udemy app with TypeScript. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.
Shot the BUGS!! Aim for a bug free day...

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->

- [this app look good, tough although going through the tutorial because so many jargon not within my knowledge, type set still mile away from perfect relying too heavily to get rid of red tubifex worm haunting me day in day out. One expert once say do the app once, make it work, now time to redo a second time, make it better with type set, rewrite from scratch, you have the manual now... go follow it and rewrite it to see what other firework can I create... Well done... now time to go for the Blog App practice while take one to two hour to re-enact this restaurant app but with a better UI/UX and type set](https://i.imgur.com/BdhEEVO.png)

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Try to code with lesser research and reference, embrace learning through failures, next 4 week to train myself yellow duck methods.
- Code with think aloud methods.
- Time Management
  - Where is the balance between learn, work, life and rest.
- Slow typing speed
  - How to speed up typing speed?
- Reading speed
  - Comprehended the logic but not the code.
- Memory skills
  - What causing me to lose my memory?
- "Make it Better" <== my personal workflow
  - learn to throw away code and start over again will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub.
- Logic & analytical thinking:
  - I should find a way to think in logical frames to solve problems.
  - important to have strong logical and analytical thinking  capabilities to decide which language or piece of code best suited for each user story.
- Detail-oriented:
  - how to ensure the precise accuracy in writing pieces of code?
  - important to have strong attention to detail to protect my work, remain efficient and prevent bugs.
- Creativity:
  - learn to recognize the potential for technological solutions to everyday problems.
  - important to understand how React Native + TypeScript works, the more creative ways to solve potential problems.
- Resourcefulness + independence:
  - able to complete individual tasks and later combine them together with other.
  - important to remain resourceful and to habe confidence in my own ability to find a solution to any coding problem that might arise.
- Curiosity:
  - important to remain curious about coding and various languages and technologies.
- Time-boxing to strict 90 minutes per task with a 20min rest break.

- Day 38 ==> Continue to work on React Native + TypeScript exercise project to practice concepts, its feature, workflows and how to enhance it with material UI CSS fundamentals.

- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.

- Required improvement on technical writing of learning experience and daily lesson task reviews with a better layout.

- Read 1 chapter / 30min of Computational Thinking.

- add one more column for non-technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- try to practice these 9 principles for 52 weeks:
  1. Understand the Basics;
  2. Write Easy To Understand And Logical Programming Codes
  3. Try Analyzing my Code
  4. Read As Many Books I Can
  5. Talking to a fellow programmer
  6. Help others In Solving Their Problems
  7. Contribution to Open Source and Signing-up mailing lists
  8. Practice It Many Times As Possible
  9. Participate In Different Events

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

==============================================================================

## MY GOAL for May

### Aim to create a personal work flow of writing code from scratch to practice and improve my skills.
