# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 21:
FIND LOST or MISPLACED ITEMS:
  You know all things; 
  You know where MY CAREER Path is, and you now reveal to me where it is. 
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Dharma: **"Purpose in Life"** <br/>
Seek my higher "SELF". Discover my unique talents. Ask myself how I am best suited to serve humanity. <br/>
Using my unique talents and serving others bring unlimited bliss and abundance. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Dharma into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. Today I will lovingly nurture the god and goddess in embryo that lies deep within my soul. I will pay attention to the spirit within me that animated both my body and my mind. I will awaken myself to this deep stillness within my heart. I will carry the consciousness of timeless, eternal Being in the midst of time-bound experience. 
  2. I will make a list of my unique talents. Then I will list all the things that I love to do while expressing my unique talents. When I express my unique talents and use them in the service of humanity, i lose track of time and create abundance in my life as well as in the lives of others. 
  3. I will ask myself daily, "How can I serve?" and "How can I help?" The answers to these questions will allow me to help and serve my fellow human beings with love. -->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
The Effective Truth<br/>
Judge people by the result of their actions and maneuvers, and not by the stories they tell. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man always said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
Don't get upset. Do the right thing -- with kindness, modesty and sincerity." - Marcus Aurelius <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful to:** be healthy, although not perfectly, it could be much worse. <br/>

<!-- what has holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Core Traits of a **"SOCIALLY INTELLIGENT PERSON"**: <br/>
They DO NOT argue with people who only want to win, not learn. <br/>
I can identify that this is the case when people start "pulling" for arguments or resorting to shoddy logic only to seem as though they have an upper hand. <br/> Socially intelligent people know that not everybody wants to communicate, learn, grow or connect -- and so they do not try to force them. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When would this work?
- Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [x] What do I prefer: socializing with a large group of friends or talk one on one? <br/>
- [x] Do I bring positivity into my friendships? If so, how?<br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

<!-- Coding as a Career -->
<!-- learn remind myself how much I have to learn -->
<!-- learn stop trying to prove myself right
  - ask myself how I can make this better?
  - actively look for where I am wrong? -->
<!-- learn "the code works" isn't where I stop; it's where I start!!
  - step 1 ==> always write quality code that fulfils the spec
  - step 2 ==> Now, make it better!!
    1. Is it valuable to make it faster?
    2. easier to document?
    3. more reusable?
    4. more reliable? -->
<!-- learn write it THREE times
  - First time ==> write the software to prove myself that the solution is possible;
  - Second time ==> make it work
  - Third time ==> make it work right
  - throw away code and start over will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub. -->
<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

<!-- Strategies that help me to push through beginner phase:
  - I will continue to make programs from scratch
    - start writing my own code, without instruction
    - start with an empty file, and type every line of code myself
    - look at other people's code
    - Analyse other people's code
    - learn a little bit about how it works, then write it myself
  - I will start small, very small
    - make something that would be useful in real life
    - start with load of make text-based games, time tracker, to-do list, or something to automate calculations
    - use these projects to learn all of the features of JavaScript, React, and TypeScript
  - write lots of code
    - I have to make software to gain skill
    - The program I make will not do much, and it will probably have messy code, but that doesn't matter
    - read some theory, get some advice, and make a new program
    - each program I make should be bigger and better than the last
    - Repeat these steps for long enough, and I will become an expert
  - ask for help
    - it's OK to ask for help only if I do these:
      - always try to google my problem first
      - analyse the answer and learn the cause behind my error
      - this way, when I encounter the same error again, I will already know how to fix it
    - If I constantly hitting unsolvable problems, that probably means that my project is too ambitious
    - Scale it back, and make something smaller until my skills improve
  - asking help the right way
    - **paste in my exact error message**
      - this is the most important piece of information
    - if there is no error message, **explain what I expected to happen, and what actually happened**
      - something like "I expect it to output 5, but it actually outputs 7"
      - Often, the problem isn't in my code, it's in my expectations
      - If I don't explain what I expected, I will get answers like "the code looks fine" and "what is the problem?"
    - **paste in my broken code**
      - It's very difficult to debug a problem without seeing the code
      - paste it all in, if it's not too big, because people will run my code to investigate the problem
      - If there is too much code, paste it into a Github Gist or Pastebin.com, then put the link into my question
    - **format my code correctly**
      - don't just paste in my code like normal text
      - learn how to format my code nicely so it is easy to read

```python
# It should look like this:

def foobar
  puts 1 + 2 / 3
end
```

```python
# Not like this:

def foobar
puts 1+2/3
end
```

- **mention what I have already tried**
  - this tells people that I've already put in some effort.

- **try to use correct terminology**
  - make an effort to learn the common terms, and use them correctly.

## Personal Notes

**Day 55 (Saturday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday will be learning advance state management with useContext to manage global state management, work on a Udemy's Blog App. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
- **Fundamental**
  - [The five basic elements](https://study.com/academy/lesson/5-basic-elements-of-programming.html), in programming are:
    - **Input**: getting data and commands into the computer
    - **Output**: getting your results out of the computer
    - **Variables and data structures**: storing information, which may change over time
    - **Mathematical operations (arithmetic)**: Performing mathematical calculations on your data
    - **Looping and conditionals**: testing to see if a condition is true of false, and cycling through a set of instructions until some condition is met

  - [Computer Programming - Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_basics.htm)

  - [Naming Conventions](https://unional.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/pages/default/draft/naming-conventions.html)
    - Single letter names
      - Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming.
    - Name casing
      - Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances. eslint: camelCase jscs: requireCamelCaseOrUpperCaseIdentifiers
      - Use PascalCase when naming constructors or classes. eslint: new-cap jscs: requireCapitalizedConstructors
      - Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function's name.
      - Use PascalCase when you export a singleton / function library / bare object.
    - Name prefixes
      - Use a leading underscore _ when naming private properties. eslint: no-underscore-dangle jscs: disallowDanglingUnderscores
    - this reference
      - Don't save references to this. Use arrow functions or Function#bind. jscs: disallowNodeTypes
    - File naming
      - If your file exports a single class, your filename should be exactly the name of the class.

==============================================================================

- **What am I Learning/Working on now?**

- **TOPIC**
- I want to learn Docker & how to:
  - Build and run an image as a container
  - Share images using Docker Hub
  - Deploy Docker applications using multiple containers with a database
  - Running applications using Docker Compose

- learn about the best practices for building images, including instructions on how to scan my images for security vulnerabilities

- **CONCEPTS: Use Docker Compose**
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications
  - With Compose, I can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command, can spin everything up or tear it all down
- The big advantage of using Compose is I can define my application stack in a file, keep it at the root of my project repo (it's now version controlled), and easily enable someone else to contribute to my project
- Someone would only need to clone my repo and start the compose app
- In fact, I might see quite a few projects on GitHub/GitLab doing exactly this now

- **step 1**
- **Install Docker Compose**
  - If I installed Docker Desktop/Toolbox for either Windows or Mac, I should have _Docker Compose_
  - _Play-with-Docker_ instances already have Docker Compose installed as well
  - If I'm using a Linux machine, I will need to install Docker Compose.
    - After installation, I should be able to run the following and see version information

```bash
# install docker-compose on linux
sudo apt install docker-compose
# check version
 docker-compose version
```

- **step 2**
- **Create the Compose file**
  1. At the root of the app project, create a file named _docker-compose.yml_
  2. In the compose file, let's start off by defining the schema version
  - In most cases, it's best to use the latest supported version
  - I can look at the [Compose file reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) for the current schema versions and the compatibility matrix.
  3. Next, I define the list of services (or containers) I want to run as part of our application

```bash
touch ./app/docker-compose.yml
```

```yml
# defining the schema version
version: "3.7"

services:
```

- And now, let's start migrating a service at a time into the compose file

- **step 3**
- **Define the app service**
  - Still remember, this was the command we were using to define our app container

```bash
docker run -dp 3000:3000 \              #ports
-w /app -v "$(pwd):/app" \              #working_dir & volumes
--network todo-app \
-e MYSQL_HOST=mysql \                   #environment
-e MYSQL_USER=root \                    #environment
-e MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret \              #environment
-e MYSQL_DB=todos \                     #environment
node:12-alpine \                        #image
sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev"    #command
```

1. First, let's define the service entry and the image for the container

- I can pick any name for the service, i call it **app**
- The name will automatically become a network alias, which will be useful when defining our MySQL service

2. Typically, I will see the **command** close to the **image** definition, although there is no requirement on ordering, so let's move that into our file
3. Let's migrate the **-p 3000:3000** part of the command by defining the **ports** for the service. I can use the [short syntax](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#short-syntax-1) here, but there is also a more verbose [long syntax](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#long-syntax-1) available as well.
4. Next, let's migrate both the working directory (**-w /app**) and the volume mapping (**-v "$(pwd):/app"**) by using the **working_dir** and **volumes** definitions. Volumes also has a [short](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/08_using_compose/) and [long syntax](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#long-syntax-3).

- _One advantage of Docker Compose volume definitions is I can use relative paths from the current directory_

5. Finally, let's migrate the environment variable definitions using the environment key

```yml
# defining the schema version
version: "3.7"

# define the service entry and the image for the container
services:
  app:                      #1 pick whatever-I-name-it for the service
    image: node:12-alpine                         #2
    command: sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev" #2
    ports:                                        #3
      - 3000:3000
    working_dir: /app                             #4
    volumes:                                      #4
      - ./:/app
    environment:
      MYSQL_HOST: mysql
      MYSQL_USER: root
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: secret
      MYSQL_DB: todos
```

- **step 4**
- **Define the MySQL service**
  - Now, it's time to define the MySQL service
  - Still remember, the command that I used for that container:

```bash
docker run -d \                             #
--network todo-app --network-alias mysql \
-v todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql \         #volumes
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret \
-e MYSQL_DATABASE=todos \
mysql:5.7                                   #image
```

1. Let's first define the new service and name it **mysql** so it automatically gets the network alias and specify the image to use as well
2. Next, I'll define the volume mapping

- When I ran the container with **docker run**, the named volume was created automatically
- However, that doesn't happen when running with Compose
- So I need to define the volume in the top-level **volumes**: section and then specify the mountpoint in the service config
- By simply providing only the volume name, the default options are used
- There are [many more options available](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volume-configuration-reference) though

3. Finally, I only need to specify the environment variables

```yml
# defining the schema version
version: '3.7'

 # The app service definition
services:
  mysql:                                #1
    image: mysql:5.7                    #1
    volumes:                            #2
      - todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:                        #3
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
      MYSQL_DATABASE: todos

volumes:                                #2
  todo-mysql-data:
```

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

==============================================================================

- **At this point, if no typos my complete _docker-compose.yml_ should look like this:**

```yml
version: "3.7"

services:
  app:
    image: node:12-alpine
    command: sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev"
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    working_dir: /app
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    environment:
      MYSQL_HOST: mysql
      MYSQL_USER: root
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: secret
      MYSQL_DB: todos

  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    volumes:
      - todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
      MYSQL_DATABASE: todos

volumes:
  todo-mysql-data:
```

- **step 5**
- **Run the application stack**
  - Now that I have our **docker-compose.yml** file, Let's start it up!
  
1. Make sure no other copies of the app/db are running first

- (docker ps and docker rm -f <ids>).

2. Start up the application stack using the **docker-compose up** command,add the **-d flag** to run everything in the background

```bash
docker-compose up -d

# When run I should see output like this:
Creating network "app_default" with the default driver
Creating volume "app_todo-mysql-data" with default driver
Creating app_app_1   ... done
Creating app_mysql_1 ... done

# The volume was created as well as a network!
# By default, Docker Compose automatically creates a network specifically for the application stack (which is why I don't have to define one in the compose file)
```

3. Let's look at the logs using the **docker-compose logs -f** command

- I'll see the logs from each of the services interleaved into a single stream
- This is incredibly useful when I want to watch for timing-related issues
- The **-f flag** "follows" the log, so will give me live output as it is generated

```bash
docker-compose logs -f

# After running the command, I'll should see output that looks like this:
app_1    | Waiting for mysql:3306.........
app_1    | Connected!
app_1    | Connected to mysql db at host mysql
app_1    | Listening on port 3000
mysql_1  | 2022-05-30T03:53:57.797595Z 0 [Note] mysqld: ready for connections.
mysql_1  | Version: '5.7.38'  socket: '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'  port: 3306  MySQL Community Server (GPL)

# The service name is displayed at the beginning of the line (often colored) to help distinguish messages
# If I want to view the logs for a specific service, I can add the service name to the end of the logs command 
# (for example, docker-compose logs -f app)
```

4. At this point, I should be able to open the app and see it running
[My Docker](https://i.imgur.com/9mgKzfu.png)

- **See the app stack in Docker Dashboard**
  - Look at the Docker Dashboard, I'll see that there is a group named **app**
  - This is the "project name" from Docker Compose and used to group the containers together
    - By default, the project name is simply the name of the directory that the _docker-compose.yml_ was located in
  - If I [twirl down the app](https://i.imgur.com/QxB5kjv.png), I should see the two containers that defined in the compose file
    - The names are also a little more descriptive, as they follow the pattern of **<project-name>_<service-name>_<replica-number>**
    - So, it's very easy to quickly see what container is our app and which container is the mysql database

- **TIP**
  - Waiting for the DB before starting the app
    - When the app is starting up, it actually sits and waits for MySQL to be up and ready before trying to connect to it
    - Docker doesn't have any built-in support to wait for another container to be fully up, running, and ready before starting another container
    - For Node-based projects, I can use the [wait-port](https://github.com/dwmkerr/wait-port) dependency
    - Similar projects exist for other languages/frameworks

- **Tear it all down**
  - When I'm ready to tear it all down, simply **run docker-compose down** or hit the trash can on the Docker Dashboard for the entire app
  - The containers will stop and the network will be removed

- **Warning**
  - **_Removing Volumes_**
    - By default, _named volumes_ in my compose file are **NOT** removed when running **docker-compose down**
    - If I want to remove the volumes, I will need to add the **--volumes flag**
- The Docker Dashboard does not remove volumes when you delete the app stack
  - Once torn down, I can switch to another project, run **docker-compose up** and be ready to contribute to that project

- **Recap**
  - I had learned about Docker Compose and how it helps us dramatically simplify the defining and sharing of multi-service applications
  - I created a Compose file by translating the commands I was using into the appropriate compose form

- **CONCEPTS: Image-building best practices**
  
- **Security scanning**
  - When I have built an image, it is a good practice to scan it for security vulnerabilities using the **docker scan** command
  - Docker has partnered with [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) to provide the vulnerability scanning service
- I must be logged in to Docker Hub in order to scan my images
  - Run the command **docker scan --login**, and then scan your images using **docker scan <image-name>**

```bash
# For example, to scan the getting-started image I created earlier in the tutorial, I can just type:
docker scan getting-started

# The scan uses a constantly updated database of vulnerabilities, so the output I see will vary as new vulnerabilities are discovered, but it might look something like this:

# As well as scanning my newly built image on the command line, I can also configure Docker Hub to scan all newly pushed images automatically, and I can then see the results in both Docker Hub and Docker Desktop
```

- **Image layering**
  1. I can look at what makes up an image:
    
- by using the docker image history command, I can see the command that was used to create each layer within an image
- use the docker image history command to see the layers in the getting-started image I created earlier

```bash
docker image history getting-started

# I should get output that looks something like this:

# Each of the lines represents a layer in the image
# The display here shows the base at the bottom with the newest layer at the top
# Using this, I can also quickly see the size of each layer, helping diagnose large images
```

2. Notice that several of the lines are truncated

- If I add the **--no-trunc flag**, I'll get the full output (yes... funny how I use a truncated flag to get untruncated output, huh?)

```bash
docker image history --no-trunc getting-started
```

- **Layer caching**
  - The layering in action, there's an important lesson to learn to help decrease build times for my container images
    - Once a layer changes, all downstream layers have to be recreated as well

```dockerfile
# Let's look at the Dockerfile I am using one more time...

# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM node:12-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN yarn install --production
CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]

# Going back to the image history output, I see that each command in the Dockerfile becomes a new layer in the image
# Do I remember that when I made a change to the image, the yarn dependencies had to be reinstalled?
# Is there a way to fix this?
# It doesn't make much sense to ship around the same dependencies every time we build, right?

# To fix this, let's restructure our Dockerfile to help support the caching of the dependencies
# For Node-based applications, those dependencies are defined in the package.json file
# So, what if we copied only that file in first, install the dependencies, and then copy in everything else?
# Then, we only recreate the yarn dependencies if there was a change to the package.json. Make sense?
```

- **Let's refactor**

1. Update the **Dockerfile** to copy in the package.json first, install dependencies, and then copy everything else in

```dockerfile
 # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
 FROM node:12-alpine
 WORKDIR /app
 COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
 RUN yarn install --production
 COPY . .
 CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
```

2. Create a file named **.dockerignore** in the same folder as the Dockerfile with the following contents.

```bash
touch ./app/.dockerignore

# add this:
node_modules
```

- **.dockerignore** files are an easy way to selectively copy only image relevant files. You can read more about this [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file)
- In this case, the node_modules folder should be omitted in the second COPY step because otherwise, it would possibly overwrite files which were created by the command in the RUN step
- For further details on why this is recommended for Node.js applications and other best practices, have a look at their guide on [Dockerizing a Node.js web app](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/)

3. Build a new image using **docker build**

```bash
docker build -t getting-started .

# I should see output like this:

```

4. Now, make a change to the **src/static/index.html** file 

- (like change the <title> to say "The Awesome Todo App").

5. Rebuild the Docker image now using **docker build -t getting-started .**
  
- This time, my output should look a little different

```bash
docker build -t getting-started .

# I should notice that the build was MUCH faster!
# And, see that steps 1-4 all have Using cache
# So, hooray! I'm using the build cache
# Pushing and pulling this image and updates to it will be much faster as well. Hooray!!!!!!
```

- **Multi-stage builds**
  - Multi-stage builds are an incredibly powerful tool to help use multiple stages to create an image
    - There are several advantages for them:
      - Separate build-time dependencies from runtime dependencies
      - Reduce overall image size by shipping only what your app needs to run

- **React example**
  - When building React applications, I need a Node environment to compile the JS code (typically JSX), SASS stylesheets, and more into static HTML, JS, and CSS
  - IfI'm not doing server-side rendering, I don't even need a Node environment for our production build
  - Why not ship the static resources in a static nginx container?

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM node:12 AS build
WORKDIR
Learn more about the "WORKDIR" Dockerfile command.
 /app
COPY package* yarn.lock ./
RUN yarn install
COPY public ./public
COPY src ./src
RUN yarn run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Here, I'm using a node:12 image to perform the build (maximizing layer caching) and then copying the output into an nginx container
```

- **Recap**
  - By understanding a little bit about how images are structured, I can build images faster and ship fewer changes
  - Scanning images gives me confidence that the containers I am running and distributing are secure
  - Multi-stage builds also help me reduce overall image size and increase final container security by separating build-time dependencies from runtime dependencies

- **JARGON in laymen terms:**
  - [schema](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/schema/)
    - [What is Schema?](https://techterms.com/definition/schema)
    - is an outline, diagram, or model
  - [truncated](https://techterms.com/definition/truncate)
    - is to shorten it, or cut part of it off

=============================================================================

- **CONCEPTS: Share the Application**
  - To share Docker images, I have to use a Docker registry
  - The default registry is Docker Hub and is where all of the images I've used come from

- **step 1**
- **Create a Repo**
  - To push an image, we first need to create a repository on Docker Hub
  - [Sign up](https://www.docker.com/pricing?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs_driven_upgrade) or Sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
  1. Click the Create Repository button
  2. For the repo name, use _getting-started_
  3. Make sure the Visibility is Public
  4. Click the Create button!

- If you look at the image below an example Docker command can be seen. This command will push to this repo
![docker repo command](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/images/push-command.png)

- **step 2**
- **Push the Image**
  1. In the command line, try running the push command you see on Docker Hub

```bash
docker push craftomecj/getting-started
Using default tag: latest
The push refers to repository [docker.io/craftomecj/getting-started]
An image does not exist locally with the tag: craftomecj/getting-started

# Why did it fail?
# The push command was looking for an image named craftomecj/getting-started, but didn't find one
# If I run docker image ls
docker image ls
# I won't see one either

# To fix this, I need to "tag" the existing image I've built to give it another name
```

2. Login to the Docker Hub using the command docker login -u YOUR-USER-NAME.

```bash
docker login -u craftomecj
```

3. Use the **docker tag** command to give the _getting-started_ image a new name

```bash
docker tag getting-started craftomecj/getting-started
```

4. Now try your push command again

- If I'm copying the value from Docker Hub, I can drop the _:tagname_ portion, as I didn't add a tag to the image name
- If I don't specify a tag, Docker will use a tag called _latest_

```bash
docker push craftomecj/getting-started
```

- **Run the image on a new instance**
  - Now that our image has been built and pushed into a registry
    - let's try running our app on a brand new instance that has never seen this container image!
    - To do this, we will use [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) a sandbox environment
      1. Open the browser to Play with Docker.
      2. Click Login and then select docker from the drop-down list.
      3. Connect with Docker Hub account.
      4. Once I've logged in, click on the **ADD NEW INSTANCE** option on the left side bar. After a few seconds, a terminal window opens in the browser
      5. In the labs.play-with-docker.com terminal, start my freshly pushed app

```bash
# @https://labs.play-with-docker.com/p/ca9pf8g9jotg00bbafgg#ca9pf8g9_ca9pfq433d5g0084nfq0
docker run -dp 3000:3000 craftomecj/getting-started
```

[I should see the image get pulled down and eventually start up!](https://i.imgur.com/rxpouRf.png)

- Click on the **3000** badge when it comes up and I should see the app with your modifications! Hooray! 
- If the 3000 badge doesn't show up, I can click on the "Open Port" button and type in 3000

- **Recap**
  - I learned how to share the _images_ by pushing them to a registry
  - I then went to a brand new instance and were able to run the freshly pushed image with a sandbox environment
  - This is quite common in CI pipelines, where the pipeline will create the image and push it to a registry and then the production environment can use the latest version of the image

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
