# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 21:
FIND LOST or MISPLACED ITEMS:
  You know all things; 
  You know where MY CAREER Path is, and you now reveal to me where it is. 
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Karma: **What We Sow is What We Reap**<br/>
Every action generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind. <br/>
Choosing actions that bring happiness and success to others ensures the flow of happiness and success to me.<br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Karma into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. Today I will witness the choices I make each moment. And in the mere witnessing of these choices. I will bring them to my concious awareness. I will know that the best way to prepare for any moment in the future is to be fully conscious in the present.
  2. Whenever I made a choice, I will ask myself two questions:
     1. What are the consequences of this choice that I'm making?
     2. Will this choice bring fulfilment and happiness to me and also to those who are affected by this choice?
  3. I will then ask my heart for guidance and be guided by its message of comfort or discomfort. If the choice feels comfortable, I will plunge ahead with abandon. If the choice feels uncomfortable, I will pause and see the consequences of my action with my inner vision. This guidance will enable me to make spontaneously correct choices for myself and for all those around me. -->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Easy Money<br/>
Be suspicious of anyone dangling the lure of something for nothing. Get rich schemes are scams. <br/>
The lottery is really a tax on the mathematically illiterate. There are no shortcuts to power. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man always said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"It is never too late to be what you might have been." - George Eliot <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful to:** have riches, not in money, but in people I'm blessed with <br/>

<!-- what has holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Core Traits of a **"SOCIALLY INTELLIGENT PERSON"**: <br/>
They know how to practice healthy disassociation.<br/>
In other words, they know that the world does not revolve around them. They are able to listen to someone without worrying that any given statement they make is actually a slight against them. <br/> They are able to disassociate from their own projections and at least try to understand another person's perspective without assuming it has everything to do with their own. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When would this work?
- Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [x] What am I doing on a daily/weekly/monthly/yearly basis to improve myself? <br/>
- [x]Are there any goals that I "started" working on a long time ago, but which in fact still remain in the realm of unmaterialized plans? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

  - ask myself how I can make this better?
  - actively look for where I am wrong? -->
<!-- learn "the code works" isn't where I stop; it's where I start!!
  - step 1 ==> always write quality code that fulfils the spec
  - step 2 ==> Now, make it better!!
    1. Is it valuable to make it faster?
    2. easier to document?
    3. more reusable?
    4. more reliable? -->
<!-- learn write it THREE times
  - First time ==> write the software to prove myself that the solution is possible;
  - Second time ==> make it work
  - Third time ==> make it work right
  - throw away code and start over will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub. -->
<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to my Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 51 (Tuesday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday will be learning advance state management with useContext to manage global state management, work on a Udemy's Tracker App. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
- **Fundamental**
  - [The five basic elements](https://study.com/academy/lesson/5-basic-elements-of-programming.html), in programming are:
    - Input: getting data and commands into the computer
    - Output: getting your results out of the computer
    - Looping and conditionals: testing to see if a condition is true of false, and cycling through a set of instructions until some condition is met
    - Mathematical operations (arithmetic): Performing mathematical calculations on your data
    - Variables and data structures: storing information, which may change over time

  - [Computer Programming - Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_basics.htm)

  - [Naming Conventions](https://unional.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/pages/default/draft/naming-conventions.html)
    - Single letter names
      - Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming.
    - Name casing
      - Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances. eslint: camelCase jscs: requireCamelCaseOrUpperCaseIdentifiers
      - Use PascalCase when naming constructors or classes. eslint: new-cap jscs: requireCapitalizedConstructors
      - Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function's name.
      - Use PascalCase when you export a singleton / function library / bare object.
    - Name prefixes
      - Use a leading underscore _ when naming private properties. eslint: no-underscore-dangle jscs: disallowDanglingUnderscores
    - this reference
      - Don't save references to this. Use arrow functions or Function#bind. jscs: disallowNodeTypes
    - File naming
      - If your file exports a single class, your filename should be exactly the name of the class.

- **What am I Learning/Working on now?**

Today, continue spending fairly good amount of time to completely dissect upcoming SHARE App code structure, still overwhelmed by lot of new jargons but an least have some form of resources to read about it in future and what their functions
At the same time spend an afternoon to try get more intimate with lovely typeScript..I spend so much time with TS, my wife is not too happy about it... lol
Managed to complete a mini project with type script too
After so many months learning programming, it still the feeling "So familiar yet so distant..."
Below are some breakdown of my works:

- **TOPIC**
 Dissecting Project Structure Part II

## ACTIVATE_HTX SHARE APP

- **CONCEPTS: Various configuration file for project**

- **File Location: /home/craftome_cj/Desktop/COMPANY-WORK-SPACE/myLearnerFolder/Blog_App/**

```typescript
// @filename: jest.config.ts
const { getJestProjects } = require('@nrwl/jest');

module.exports = {
  projects: getJestProjects(),
};
```

```javascript
// @filename: jest.preset.js
const nxPreset = require('@nrwl/jest/preset').default;

module.exports = { ...nxPreset };
```

```typescript
// @filename: jest.preset.ts
const nxPreset = require('@nrwl/jest/preset');

module.exports = { ...nxPreset };
```

- What is the purpose of
  - _jest.preset.ts_
  - _jest.preset.js_
  - [jest.config.ts](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration)
    - Add Jest Configuration to a project.
- [How to configure Jest with TypeScript](https://swizec.com/blog/how-to-configure-jest-with-typescript/)

- **File Location: /home/craftome_cj/Desktop/COMPANY-WORK-SPACE/myLearnerFolder/Blog_App/**

```json
// babel.config.json
{
  "babelrcRoots": ["*"]
}
```

- What is _babel.config.json_ file?
  - [babel.config.json](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-FILES#project-wide-configuration)
    - **babelrcRoots**
      - Type: boolean | MatchPattern | Array<MatchPattern>
      - Default: opts.root
      - Placement: Allowed in Babel's programmatic options, or inside of the loaded configFile. A programmatic option will override a config file one.
    - By default, Babel will only search for .babelrc.json FILES within the "root" package
      - because otherwise Babel cannot know if a given **.babelrc.json** is meant to be loaded,
      - or if it's "plugins" and "presets" have even been installed, since the file being compiled could be inside node_modules, or have been symlinked into the project
    - This option allows users to provide a list of other packages that should be considered "root" packages when considering whether to load **.babelrc.json** FILES.

- What is a [.prettierrc](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html) file?
  - A prettierrc file is a configuration file used by Prettier, an automated code formatting tool. 
  - It contains JSON- or YAML-formatted text that specifies a user's Prettier settings.

- **File Location: /home/craftome_cj/Desktop/COMPANY-WORK-SPACE/myLearnerFolder/Blog_App/**

```json
// @filename: .prettierrc
{
  "singleQuote": true
}
```

```bash
#  @filename: .prettierignore
# Add FILES here to ignore them from prettier formatting

# Ignore artifacts:
/dist
/coverage

# Ignore all HTML FILES:
*.html
```

- What is a [.prettierignore](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html) file?
  - To exclude FILES from formatting, create a **.prettierignore** file in the root of my project. **.prettierignore** uses [gitignore syntax](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format)
  - recommended to have a **.prettierignore** in my project!
  - This way I can run **prettier --write** to make sure that everything is formatted (without mangling FILES I don't want, or choking on generated FILES)
  - and my editor will know which FILES not to format!

- **File Location: /home/craftome_cj/Desktop/COMPANY-WORK-SPACE/myLearnerFolder/Blog_App/**

- What is [Gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) and [How to Add it to my Repo?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gitignore-what-is-it-and-how-to-add-to-repo/)
  - is a file is a text file that tells Git which FILES or folders to ignore in a project

<!-- .gitkeep at various location-->
- **File Location: /home/craftome_cj/Desktop/COMPANY-WORK-SPACE/myLearnerFolder/Blog_App/tools/generators**
- **File Location: /home/craftome_cj/Desktop/COMPANY-WORK-SPACE/myLearnerFolder/Blog_App/packages/**

```bash
# @filename: ./tools/generators/.gitkeep
# @filename: ./packages/.gitkeep

# empty on purpose

# .gitkeep is just a placeholder. A dummy file, so Git will not forget about the directory, since Git tracks only FILES.
```

- [What is .gitkeep? How to Track and Push Empty Folders in Git](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-gitkeep/)
  - is a common thing I will see in codebases, where an empty folder needs to be tracked via Git
  - The name of the dummy file may not always be **.gitkeep** but I'll see the actual practice over and over again as a developer
- [Use .gitkeep to commit and push an empty Git folder or directory](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/gitkeep-push-empty-folders-git-commit)

- What are the differences between .gitignore and .gitkeep?
  - **.gitkeep** isn't documented, because it's not a feature of Git
  - Git cannot add a completely empty directory
  - People who want to track empty directories in Git have created the convention of putting FILES called **.gitkeep** in these directories
  - The file could be called anything; Git assigns no special significance to this name
  - There is a competing convention of adding a **.gitignore** file to the empty directories to get them tracked, but some people see this as confusing since the goal is to keep the empty directories, not ignore them
  - **.gitignore** is also used to list FILES that should be ignored by Git when looking for untracked FILES.

- What is [.EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)?
  - EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs
  - The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles
  - EditorConfig FILES are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.

- **.editorconfig file JARGON in laymen terms with references:**
  - [root]
    - top-most EditorConfig file
    - special property that should be specified at the top of the file outside of any sections
    - Set to true to stop .editorconfig FILES search on current file
  - [*]
    - Matches any string of characters, except path separators (/)
  - [*.md]
    - Match certain file

- **CONCEPTS: tsconfig.json**
  - What is the purpose of _tsconfig.json_?
    - is a file corresponds to the configuration of the TypeScript compiler (tsc)
    - The presence of a [tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) file in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript project.
    - it is a file specifies the root FILES and the compiler options required to compile the project.

- **tsconfig.json JARGON in laymen terms with references:**
- [Detailed explanation of the tsconfig.json file](https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/tsconfig/)

  - [compileOnSave](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-compileOnSave-and-watch-option-of-compilerOptions-in-typescript-tsconfig-JSON?share=1)
    - The concept is that when a .ts/.tsx file is saved, then a transpile of that file and its dependencies will be triggered (note: OnSave itself implies that I are in an editor of some kind saving the file)

  - [compilerOptions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#compilerOptions)
    - These options make up the bulk of TypeScript's configuration and it covers how the language should work.

  - ["rootDir": "."](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#rootDir)
    - The default root directory of TS project is the directory where the tsconfig.json file is located, and all relative paths are relative to this root directory.
    - I can change the project's root directory location with the rootDir option. Delete the dist folder and update the tsconfig.json file.

  - ["sourceMap": true,](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#sourceMap)
    - Params: (true | false)
    - Summary:
      - Generate mappings to tie outputted code (.js) to source code (.ts)
    - When To Use:
      - When I want to make debugging my app in the browser much easier
    - Enables the generation of sourcemap FILES.
    - These FILES allow debuggers and other tools to display the original TypeScript source code when actually working with the emitted JavaScript FILES.
    - Source map FILES are emitted as .js.map (or .jsx.map) FILES next to the corresponding .js output file.
    - The source-map file represents a mapping relationship between the compiled source file and the output result file, which plays a very important role in debugging the project and allows us to display the source code in the browser developer tools for debugging.
    - If the debugger looks at the compiled code, then debugging is such a painful thing.
    - [Use a source map](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/debugger/how_to/use_a_source_map/index.html)

  - ["declaration": false,](https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/tsconfig/)
    - Params (true | false)
    - Summary:
      - Generate type definition FILES for my source to be imported elsewhere
    - When To Use:
      - When I am writing a library and want to be a courteous member of the TypeScript community and provide consumers of my library with types to improve their developer experience and help make their code safer.
    - The most important role of typescript is to make js support types and turn it into a strongly typed language.
    - Set the declaration field to true to automatically generate declaration FILES.

  - ["moduleResolution": "node",](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution)
    - Specify the module resolution strategy:
      - 'node' for Node.js' CommonJS implementation
      - 'node12' or 'nodenext' for Node.js' ECMAScript Module Support from
      - TypeScript 4.5 onwards
      - 'classic' used in TypeScript before the release of 1.6. I probably won't need to use classic in modern code
      - [Module Resolution](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html)

  - ["emitDecoratorMetadata": true,](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#emitDecoratorMetadata)
    - Enables experimental support for emitting type metadata for decorators which works with the module reflect-metadata.
  - ["experimentalDecorators": true,](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#experimentalDecorators)
    - Enables experimental support for decorators, which is in stage 2 of the TC39 standardization process.
    - Decorators are a language feature which hasn't yet been fully ratified into the JavaScript specification.
    - This means that the implementation version in TypeScript may differ from the implementation in JavaScript when it it decided by TC39.\
    - [Decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html)

  - ["importHelpers": true,](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#importHelpers)
    - For certain downleveling operations, TypeScript uses some helper code for operations like extending class, spreading arrays or objects, and async operations.
    - By default, these helpers are inserted into FILES which use them.
    - This can result in code duplication if the same helper is used in many different modules.
    - If the importHelpers flag is on, these helper functions are instead imported from the tslib module.
    - I will need to ensure that the tslib module is able to be imported at runtime.
    - This only affects modules; global script FILES will not attempt to import modules.

  - ["lib": ["es2017", "dom"],](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#lib)
    - Params:
      - (ES5|ES6|ES7|ES2017|ES2018|ES2019|ES2020|ESNext|Dom|ScriptHost|WebWorker)
    - Summary:
      - The set of language features (in the form of type definitions) I amt TypeScript to include and compile (and thus assume will be provided at runtime) so that my code can use (and my IDE understand) these newer features.
    - When To Use:
      - When I want to use newer JS features that don't exist in the version of JS that I'm targeting and need to make a promise to the TS compiler that these features will indeed exist at runtime and to compile my project under that assumption.
    - TypeScript includes a default set of type definitions for built-in JS APIs (like Math), as well as type definitions for things found in browser environments (like document).
    - TypeScript also includes APIs for newer JS features matching the target I specify; for example the definition for Map is available if target is ES6 or newer.
      - I may want to change these for a few reasons:
        - my program doesn't run in a browser, so I don't want the "dom" type definitions
        - my runtime platform provides certain JavaScript API objects (maybe through polyfills), but doesn't yet support the full syntax of a given ECMAScript version
        - I have polyfills or native implementations for some, but not all, of a higher level ECMAScript version
          - ES2017
            - Additional APIs available in ES2017 
              - Object.entries, Object.values, Atomics, SharedArrayBuffer, date.formatToParts, typed arrays, etc.
          - [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/DOM)
            - DOM definitions - window, document, etc.

  - ["target": "es2015",](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#target)
    - Params:
      - (ES3 | ES5 | ES6(ES2015) | ES7(ES2016) | ES2017 | ES2018 | ES2019 | ES2020 | ESNEXT)
    - Summary:
      - What version of JavaScript to transpile my TS code to.
    - When To Use:
      - When my app needs to run in environments that only support a particular (older) version of JavaScript, I amcify that version here.
    - I might choose to set a lower target if my code is deployed to older environments, or a higher target if my code is guaranteed to run in newer environments.
    - The target setting changes which JS features are downlevel and which are left intact.
      - For example, an arrow function () => this will be turned into an equivalent function expression if target is ES5 or lower.
    - Changing target also changes the default value of lib.
    - I may "mix and match" target and lib settings as desired, but I could just set target for convenience.
    - For developer platforms like Node there are baselines for the target, depending on the type of platform and its version.
    - I can find a set of [community organized TSConfigs at tsconfig/bases](https://github.com/tsconfig/bases), which has configurations for common platforms and their versions.
    - The special ESNext value refers to the highest version my version of TypeScript supports.
    - This setting should be used with caution, since it doesn't mean the same thing between different TypeScript versions and can make upgrades less predictable.
      - ES2015
        - Additional APIs available in ES2015 (also known as ES6) 
          - array.find, Promise, Proxy, Symbol, Map, Set, Reflect, etc.

  - ["module": "esnext",](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#module)
    - Params:
      - (CommonJS|ES6(ES2015)|ES2020|None|UMD|AMD|System|ESNext)
    - Summary:
      - The module system that the outputted JS will operate under.
    - When To Use:
      - Safe to leave as default unless I am targeting browsers and not using a bundler (eg: Webpack) that can understand CommonJS or plan on targeting newer environments and want to use ES6 Modules.
    - Suppose I are developing a project that needs to run in a nodejs environment, and in the project I use import to introduce modules, but nodejs does not support it.
    - nodejs uses the CommonJS module system.
    - To convert the compiled js file import statements to require statements, I can configure "module": "CommonJS"
      - [esnext](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63561423/what-does-module-type-esnext-means-in-tsconfig-json-file)
        - is a JavaScript library for converting JavaScript written using the ES6 draft specification syntax to JavaScript that will work today.
        - The special ESNext value refers to the highest version my version of TypeScript supports.
        - This setting should be used with caution, since it doesn't mean the same thing between different TypeScript versions and can make upgrades less predictable.

  - ["skipLibCheck": true,](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#skipLibCheck)
    - Skip type checking of declaration FILES.
    - This can save time during compilation at the expense of type-system accuracy.
      - For example, two libraries could define two copies of the same type in an inconsistent way.
      - Rather than doing a full check of all d.ts FILES, TypeScript will type check the code I specifically refer to in my app's source code.
    - A common case where I might think to use skipLibCheck is when there are two copies of a library's types in my node_modules.
    - In these cases, I should consider using a feature like yarn's resolutions to ensure there is only one copy of that dependency in my tree or investigate how to ensure there is only one copy by understanding the dependency resolution to fix the issue without additional tooling.

  - ["skipDefaultLibCheck": true,](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#skipDefaultLibCheck)
    - Skip type checking of default library declaration FILES.

  - ["baseUrl": ".",](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#baseUrl)
    - set a base directory to resolve non-absolute module names.
    - With "baseUrl": "./" inside this project TypeScript will look for FILES starting at the same folder as the tsconfig.json.

  - ["paths": {}](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths)
    - A series of entries which re-map imports to lookup locations relative to the baseUrl.
    - There is a larger coverage of paths in the [handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#path-mapping).

  - ["exclude": [],](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#exclude)
    - Specifies an array of filenames or patterns that should be skipped when resolving include.
    - **Important:** exclude only changes which FILES are included as a result of the include setting.
    - A file specified by exclude can still become part of Ir codebase due to an import statement in Ir code, a types inclusion, a _reference_ directive, or being specified in the [FILES](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#FILES) list.
    - It is not a mechanism that prevents a file from being included in the codebase - it simply changes what the include setting finds.

  - ["include": ["packages/**/*"]](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#include)
    - Specifies an array of filenames or patterns to include in the program.
    - These filenames are resolved relative to the directory containing the tsconfig.json file.

- include and exclude support wildcard characters to make glob patterns:
  - '*' matches zero or more characters (excluding directory separators)
  - '?' matches any one character (excluding directory separators)
  - '**/' matches any directory nested to any level
    - If a glob pattern doesn't include a file extension, then only FILES with supported extensions are included (e.g. .ts, .tsx, and .d.ts by default, with .js and .jsx if allowJs is set to true).

## Exercise of the Day

TypeScript **_Revisited_ Day 5**

[x] **Challenge:** Read ==> TypeScript Quickly (aim to improve TypeScript Implementations)

## Today's Summary

- Declaring variable types forces me to write more code, my productivity increases in the long run;
- TS offers a number of type annotations, but I can declare custom types as needed;
- I can create new types by declaring union of existing ones;
- I can declare custom types using the type, interface and class keywords;
- TS uses a structural type system as opposed to languages like JAVA or C#, which use a nominal type system.

## So do I know now?

- **CONCEPTS**
  - [How To Do Anything in TypeScript With Type Guards](https://camchenry.com/blog/typescript-type-guards)
  - [Typescript Type guards: Using the in operator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57594637/typescript-type-guards-using-the-in-operator)

  - [Type Guards and Control Flow Analysis in TypeScript 4.4](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/typescript-4-4-be-on-your-guard-7e3bb2e3ebbe)
  - [The _in_ type guard](https://ultimatecourses.com/blog/typescript-literal-type-guards-and-in-operator)
    - It acts as a narrowing expression for types.
    - For example, if I have a function that can take an argument of a union type, I can check the actual type given during function invocation.
    - Type guards are conditional checks that allow types to be narrowed from general types to more specific ones.
    - With type guards, we do run-time type checking and ensure that code is safe.

- **using in type guard to check if the provided object has a specific property before using it**

```TypeScript
// so how ah?? After a two day break, brain rusty liao buay har?? there is one more useful type guard not talk about yet hor...
// so how can remember we touch on typeof, instanceof, discriminated union guard liao... siao liao buay ki liao tio bo... pls go refer back to 20220519, 20220520, 20220521 notes and read lei... wao lao wei!! write until so long essay don't want go revision.. like that how can remember ...
//okay lah.. give you some fresher... swee bo? 
// Remember ah: typeof can only tell us if a type is string, number, boolean, symbol, function, bigint, undefined. Everything else will return "object".
// Remember ah: instanceof we can test if an object is an instance of, or derived from, a class.
// Remember ah: discriminated Union is a design where the types within a union each contain a member that uniquely identifies or allows the compiler to discriminate that type.
// now let's talk about 'in' eh sai buay har?? 
// What is in guard??
//The in operator allows me to test an object for the existence of a member, understand bo??

// the following code show two interfaces with different properties.
// The foo() function can take an object A || B as an argument. 
// using the 'in' type guard, the foo() function can check if the provided object has a specific property before using it.

interface A { a: number };
interface B { b: string };

function foo (x: A | B ) {
  if ('a' in x) {        // <----- checks for specific property using 'in'
    return x.a;
  } else {
    return x.b
  }
}
// the property that I checking has to be a string, such as 'a' ah bo ah...Boss TS will scream loh... 

// tell you ah.. 'in' can only be used if ALL members of the union are object types (not primitives)
```

- The 'any' types haha... time to get serious to understand how not to use it!!!

- **CONCEPTS**
  - The any & unknown types, and user-defined type guards
    - [How to write a user defined type guard for "string" | "literal" | "types"?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41984719/how-to-write-a-user-defined-type-guard-for-string-literal-types)

    - [Using the unknown type](https://learntypescript.dev/03/l7-unknown)

- **using the any type**

```TypeScript
// let's try an infamous the 'any' type example to show the difference between any & unknown.
// let assume we declared the Person type on the frontend, it's populated with data coming from the back-end in JSON format.
// to turn the JSON string into an object, I'll use the method JSON.parse(), which returns any:

type Person = {       // <----- declares a type alias
  address: string;
}

let person1: any;      // <----- declares a variable of type 'any'

person1 = JSON.parse(
  '{ "adress": "300 Orchard Road" }' // <--- parses the JSON string
);

console.log(person1.address); // <--- this prints undefined

// why is that so???
// because I misspelled 'address' in the JSON string.
// So the parse method returns JS object that has an adress property, but not address on person1.
```

- **complier's error with the type unknown**

```typescript
// let's use the same use case see how it works with a variable of type 'unknown'

let Person2: unknown;   // <--- declares a variable of type unknown

person2 = JSON.parse(
  '{ "adress": "300 Orchard Road" }'
);

console.log(person2.address);  //<--- let try to use a variable of the unknown type results in a compilation error

// hahaha see... Boss TS don't even bother compiling for you... 
// why is that so???
// because I tried to use the person2 variable of unknown type without narrowing its type down
```

- **The first version of user-defined: isPerson type guard & Applying the isPerson type guard**

```typescript
// Kind Boss TS allow me to write user-defined type guards that can check if an object is of a particular type

// in this example, I would write a function that returns something like "thisFunctionArg is SomeType"
// so let's write with an 'isPerson()' type guard, assume that if the parameter (object) under test has an 'address' property, it's a person:

const isPerson = (object: any): object is Person => "address" in object;
// The above type guard return 'true' if the given object has an address property.

// Let me try to apply it with if elses statement:

if (isPerson(person2)) {      // <-- applies the type guard
console.log(person2.address); // <-- safely accesses the address property
} else {
  console.log("person2 is not a Person");
}
// Voila!!! no compilation error!! Boss TS is happy...
// unless the isPerson() guard gets a falsy object as an argument like passing 'null' to isPerson() will result in a runtime error 
```

```typescript
// The safer version of the isPerson() guard.
// Let's learn to use THE DOUBLE BANG operator !! will ensure that the given object is truthy with complete of earlier example:

// type any
type Person = {
    address: string;
}

let person1: any;

person1 = JSON.parse('{ "adress": "300 Orchard Road" }') as Person; 

console.log(person1.address);  // undefined during runtime

// type unknown
let person2: unknown;

person2 = JSON.parse('{ "adress": "300 Orchard Road" }'); 

// console.log(person2.address);   // compiler error

const isPerson = (object: any): object is Person =>
    !!object && "address" in object;    //<--- using double bang operator !!

if (isPerson(person2)) {
    console.log(person2.address);  
} else {
    console.log("person2 is not a Person");
}

// In this example, the existence of the 'address' property is enough to identify the Person type,
// but in some cases checking just one property is not enough
```

```typescript
// for example Organization classes may also have 'address' property
// I may need to check several properties to determine if an object matches a specific type

// I can do this to declare my own discriminator property that wil identify this type as a person:
type Person = {
  discriminator: 'person';
  address: string;
}

// then my custom type guard will look like this:
const isPerson = (object: any): object is Person => !!object && object.discriminator === 'person';
```

## A Mini Project

- **Apply Theory to Practical Time:**

- Assignment:
  - Use Case
  - Write a program with two custom types, Dog & Fish, which are declared using classes.
  - Each of these types must have a name property.
  - The Dog class should have a sayHello(): string method, and the Fish class should have a dive(howDeep: number): string method
  - Declare a new Pet type as a union of Dog | Fish
  - Write a talkToPet(Pet: Pet): string function that will use type guards and will either invoke the sayHello() method on the Dog instance or print the message "Fish cannot talk, sorry"
  - Invoke talkToPet() three times providing the object Dog first, then Fish, and finally an object that is neither Dog nor Fish

```typescript
// @filename: talkToPet.tsx
// today follow exercise using class type to complete the assignment, tomorrow I will try to change it to interface custom type

class Dog {               // declares a custom Dog type
   constructor(
     readonly name: string
     ) { };

   sayHello(): string {
     return 'Dog says hello!';
   }  
}


class Fish {              // declare a custom Fish type
    constructor(
      readonly name: string
      ) { };
   
    dive(howDeep: number): string {
     return `Diving ${howDeep} feet`;
   } 
  
}

type Pet = Dog | Fish;    // creates a union of Dog & Fish

function talkToPet(pet: Pet): string | undefined {

if (pet instanceof Dog)  // <--- use a type guard
{
  return pet.sayHello();
} 
else if (pet instanceof Fish)
{
  return 'Fish cannot talk, sorry!';
}
}

const myDog = new Dog ('Sammy');  // <--- creates an instance of a Dog
const myFish = new Fish ('Marry') // <--- creates an instance of a Fish

console.log(talkToPet(myDog));  // <--- invokes talkToPet(),
console.log(talkToPet(myFish)); // <--- passing a Pet

//talkToPet({name: 'Jerry'});     // <-- this won't compile -- wrong parameter type
```

    - If I need to transfer data from a server to a browser or mobile app, I'm going to see a lot of the JSON parse function
    - it's become the standard for handling data
  - [parse](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3853/parse)
    - To parse, in computer science, is where a string of commands - usually a program - is separated into more easily processed components,
    - which are analyzed for correct syntax and then attached to tags that define each component.
    - The computer can then process each program chunk and transform it into machine language.

    - lets me control the execution of statements based on the results of conditional expressions
    - The if statement can include multiple else and if-clauses and one else clause at the end
    - The if clause of the statement executes one or more statements if its condition is true.
    - The else if clause is executed when the previous condition or conditions are false
    - The statement or statements within an else if clause is executed if its condition is true.
    - The else clause is executed when all previous conditions are false.
  - I can code one if statement within the block of statements of an if, else if, or else clause in another if statement
    - This is referred to as nested if statements

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Try to code with lesser research and reference, embrace learning through failures, next 4 week to train myself yellow duck methods.
- Code with think aloud methods.
- Time Management
  - Where is the balance between learn, work, life and rest.
- Slow typing speed
  - How to speed up typing speed?
- Reading speed
  - Comprehended the logic but not the code.
- Memory skills
  - What causing me to lose my memory?
- "Make it Better" <== my personal workflow
  - learn to throw away code and start over again will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub.
- Logic & analytical thinking:
  - I should find a way to think in logical frames to solve problems.
  - important to have strong logical and analytical thinking  capabilities to decide which language or piece of code best suited for each user story.
- Detail-oriented:
  - how to ensure the precise accuracy in writing pieces of code?
  - important to have strong attention to detail to protect my work, remain efficient and prevent bugs.
- Creativity:
  - learn to recognize the potential for technological solutions to everyday problems.
  - important to understand how React Native + TypeScript works, the more creative ways to solve potential problems.
- Resourcefulness + independence:
  - able to complete individual tasks and later combine them together with other.
  - important to remain resourceful and to habe confidence in my own ability to find a solution to any coding problem that might arise.
- Curiosity:
  - important to remain curious about coding and various languages and technologies.
- Time-boxing to strict 90 minutes per task with a 20min rest break.

- Day 50 ==> Continue to work on React Native + TypeScript exercise project to practice concepts, its feature, workflows and how to enhance it with material UI CSS fundamentals.

- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.

- Required improvement on technical writing of learning experience and daily lesson task reviews with a better layout.

- Read 1 chapter / 30min of Computational Thinking.

- add one more column for non-technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- try to practice these 9 principles for 52 weeks:
  1. Understand the Basics;
  2. Write Easy To Understand And Logical Programming Codes
  3. Try Analyzing my Code
  4. Read As Many Books I Can
  5. Talking to a fellow programmer
  6. Help others In Solving Their Problems
  7. Contribution to Open Source and Signing-up mailing lists
  8. Practice It Many Times As Possible
  9. Participate In Different Events

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->
