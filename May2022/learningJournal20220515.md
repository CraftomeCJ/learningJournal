# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 20:
SOLVE A PROBLEM:
  My subconscious knows the answer.
  It is responding to me now. 
  I give thanks because I know the infinite spirit of my subconscious knows all the things and is revealing the perfect answer to me.
  My real conviction is now setting free the majestic and glory of my subconscious mind.
  I rejoice that it is so.
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Pure Potentiality: **"Maybe!" => Illustrate the wisdom of non-judgement**<br/>
Take time to be silent, to just BE. <br/> Meditate for 22 minutes twice per day. <br/>
Silently witness the intelligence within every living thing. Practice non-judgement. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Pure Potentiality into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. I will get in touch with the field of pure potentiality by taking time each day to be silent, to just BE. I will also sit alone in silent meditation at least twice a day for approximately 22 minutes in the morning and 22 minutes in the evening. 
  2. I will take time each day to interact with nature and to silently witness the intelligence within every living thing. I will sit silently and watch a sunset, or listen to the sound of the ocean or a stream, or simply smell the scent of a flower. In the ecstasy of my own silence, and by interacting with nature, I will enjoy the lire throb of ages, the field of pure potentiality and unlimited creativity.
  3. I will practice non-judgement. I will begin my day with this statement: "Today, I shall judge nothing that occurs, and reply "MAYBE!" to all opinion-seeking suggestions by others," and throughout the day I will remind myself not to judge. -->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
The Machiavellian Gift<br/>
Although I often view other people's actions in the most cynical light, I rarely see the Machiavellian element of a gift, which quite often hides ulterior motives. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Don't set your mind on things you don't possess as if they were yours, but count the blessings you actually possess and think how much you would desire them if they weren't already yours. But watch yourself, that you don't value these things to the point of being troubled if you should lose them." - Marcus Aurelius <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm grateful:** for every adversity, I learn to depend more on God. <br/>

<!-- what is holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Things "Emotionally Intelligent People" **DO NOT DO**: <br/>
They know that a feeling will not kill them. <br/>
They have developed enough stamina and awareness to know that all things, even the worse, are transitory. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When or Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [] Ask myself, if money was no concern and I had all the time and money in the world, what would I do? <br/>
- [] How is life calling me? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
1. Anyone can do it
2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

    2. easier to document?
    3. more reusable?
    4. more reliable? -->
<!-- learn write it THREE times

  - throw away code and start over will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub. -->
<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to my Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->
1. [Try Completing A Personal React Native + Typescript Operation Manual Ver 1.1](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/Template_RN_TS_Metro/blob/main/MANUAL.md)
2. Home chores (laundry, groceries, etc)

## Personal Notes

**Day 32 (Thursday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today till Sunday will be working on setup typeScript with React Native from scratch with simple "hello world" to make sure it works, and slowly build up a BentoApp and add dependencies one by one, debug error line by line if any. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
This morning wasted near 3 hours to solve macBook out of memory issues.

### Software Installed

### Build a BentoApp

- Objective:
  - Displaying splash screen during response time from the server is an excellent way to interact with the user. But making a loading/splash screen becomes difficult when we want to practically use an animated loader, where we need to make extra efforts to write down its styling file. To overcome this problem, we use a bunch of predefined loaders from the react-spinners module.

1. File Structure:
   1. src directory (source of components)
      - assets directory (for images & other resources)
      - welcome/splashscreen directory (SplashScreen)
      - screens directory (for loginScreen & registerScreen [UI/UX])
      - drawerscreens directory (for HomeScreen & SettingScreen)
      - to add dashboard directory (dashboard)
   2. Wire Frame

![file structure2](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/IMG/PNG/learningImgs/file2.png "style=width:200 height: 200")

<h4 align="center">Project Logo</h4>

![project logo](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/IMG/GIF/bentoLogo.gif "style=width:50 height: 50")

1. Approach:

- Step 1: write some code in App.tsx, no need to make any other components for this project. For using the predefined spinners we need to import the 'loader' component from 'react-spinners'.
- Step 2: need to 'useState" to add a state to our functional component and 'useEffect' is also needed.

- Put your side-effect logic into the callback function, then use the dependencies argument to control when you want the side-effect to run. That's the sole purpose of useEffect().

![useEffect() Hook](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/IMG/PNG/learningImgs/file3.png "style=width:200 height: 200")

- [A Simple Explanation of React.useEffect()](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-useeffect-explanation/#1-useeffect-is-for-side-effects)
- [What is useState() in React ?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-usestate-in-react/)
- [useState and useEffect explained](https://medium.com/recraftrelic/usestate-and-useeffect-explained-cdb5dc252baf)

- Step 3 ==> Add a state isLoading which will indicate that splashscreen page is loading or not.
- Step 4 ==> Add a setTimeout() method inside useEffect to make the splash screen appear for a certain time period example: 5sec.
- Step 5 ==> use a custom CSS block to override its property and use it when isLoading is true example: page is still loading.

1. Git Branch

   1. main
    - setup folder & file
    - merge safe dependencies from branch 'testing'
   2. testing
      - test npm dependencies installed
      - playground for ideas
      - merge to branch 'main/splashscreen/loginscreen/ once error free
   3. SplashScreen
      - build splashscreen
   4. LoginScreen
      - build loginscreen

## Exercise of the Day

[x] **Challenge:** Read ==> Computation Thinking (aim to improve problem-solving logic thinking skills)

- What is Computational Thinking?
- Definitions:
  - is the thinking method involved in developing solution(s) to a problem and expressing it in such a way that a computer -- human or machine -- can capably carry out.
  - is the brain activity for pulling out problems and building solutions that can be programmed.
  - is the way of picking up condition of programming in the world that surrounds us, and applying tools and techniques from Computer Science to understand and reason about both natural and artificial systems and processes.
  - is cognitive setup to plotting problems and reorganise of some input into an output and looking for set of rules to perform the transform. Today the terms has been expanded to include thinking with many levels of summary, use of mathematics to develop rule set and testing how well a solution develop across different sizes of problems.
  - teach us how to think like an economist, a physicist. an artist and to understand how to use programming to solve their problems, to create, and to discover new questions that worth worked toward meaningly.
  - is based on the idea that the solution to a problem is the product of a set of rules that can be applied to the problem.

- Computation Thinking teaches an approach to problem-solving where the ultimate aim is to provide a solution whose form mean it is ready to be programmed into a computer.
- Computation Thinking takes a relatively small subset of concepts -- which just happen to be important to Computer Science -- and uses them to develop a widely applicable, problem-solving approach.

- Summary:
  - Computation Thinking (CT) is an approach to problem-solving that involves using a set of practices and principles from Computer Science to develop a solution that is executable by a computer. It's not just for programmers. It is applicable in a diverse array of fields.

- Exercise 1:
  - List the core concepts of CT?
    - logical thinking;
    - algorithms thinking;
    - decomposition;
    - generalization and pattern recognition;
    - modelling;
    - abstraction;
    - evaluation;

- Exercise 2:
  - Give an example of how I think people in each of the following occupations think computationally:
    1. mathematician :can bu use to calculate the circumference of a circle without actually measuring it.
    2. scientist : can be use for a range of tasks in constructing simulations, statistically analyzing data, and recognizing, expressing, and applying quantitative relationships.
    3. engineer : can create based on analyses of designs to calculate whether they can stand up to the expected stress of use and if they can be completed within acceptable budgets.
    4. linguist : can be use to develop systems that can perform tasks such as speech recognition, translation, and spell checking.

- Exercise 3:
  - Think of everyday activities in which I participate that involve computational thinking:
    - scheduling my daily routine;
    - breaking difficult problems into smaller parts;
    - design a repetitive models of how to solve a problem;
    - Observation and think how things can be relate and repeated;
    - practice repetition of good habit like a loop, do it over and over again;
    - finding the bad habit that need to remove;
    - understand that one thing starts occurring since another thing is triggered

- We can do these activities:

 1. organize clean dished computationally;
 2. nearest route at the supermarket: when I'm checking out after my groceries with my wife, I can use the computer to find the shortest route to my grocery store;
 3. Clean your room computationally: clean room through sequential, systematic thinking
 4. computational thinking approach to language: I can use the computer to translate my sentence into another language.

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Try to code with lesser research and reference, embrace learning through failures, next 4 week to train myself yellow duck methods.
- Code with think aloud methods.
- Time Management
  - Where is the balance between learn, work, life and rest.
- Slow typing speed
  - How to speed up typing speed?
- Reading speed
  - Comprehended the logic but not the code.
- Memory skills
  - What causing me to lose my memory?
- "Make it Better" <== my personal workflow
  - learn to throw away code and start over again will teach me how many ways I can approach the problem and prevent me from getting stuck in a stub.
- Logic & analytical thinking:
  - I should find a way to think in logical frames to solve problems.
  - important to have strong logical and analytical thinking  capabilities to decide which language or piece of code best suited for each user story.
- Detail-oriented:
  - how to ensure the precise accuracy in writing pieces of code?
  - important to have strong attention to detail to protect my work, remain efficient and prevent bugs.
- Creativity:
  - learn to recognize the potential for technological solutions to everyday problems.
  - important to understand how React Native + TypeScript works, the more creative ways to solve potential problems.
- Resourcefulness + independence:
  - able to complete individual tasks and later combine them together with other.
  - important to remain resourceful and to habe confidence in my own ability to find a solution to any coding problem that might arise.
- Curiosity:
  - important to remain curious about coding and various languages and technologies.
- Time-boxing to strict 90 minutes per task with a 20min rest break.

- Day 38 ==> Continue to work on React Native + TypeScript exercise project to practice concepts, its feature, workflows and how to enhance it with material UI CSS fundamentals.

- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.

- Required improvement on technical writing of learning experience and daily lesson task reviews with a better layout.

- Read 1 chapter / 30min of Computational Thinking.

- add one more column for non-technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- try to practice these 9 principles for 52 weeks:
  1. Understand the Basics;
  2. Write Easy To Understand And Logical Programming Codes
  3. Try Analyzing my Code
  4. Read As Many Books I Can
  5. Talking to a fellow programmer
  6. Help others In Solving Their Problems
  7. Contribution to Open Source and Signing-up mailing lists
  8. Practice It Many Times As Possible
  9. Participate In Different Events

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->
