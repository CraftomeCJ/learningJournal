# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude -->
<!-- Week 19:
SELL MINE SKILLS or OTHER ABILITIES:
  Infinite spirit attracts to me the EMPLOYERs for my unique talents who want it and prosper in it. 
  These EMPLOYERs are being sent to me by the creative spirit of my subconscious mind, which makes no mistakes. 
  They may look at many other employees, but mine is the only one they want and will hire, because they are guided by the infinite spirit within them. 
  I know the EMPLOYER is right, the time is right, and the price is right. Everything about it is right. 
  The deeper currents of my subconscious mind are now in operation bringing us together in divine order. 
  I know that it is so.
  -->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Pure Potentiality: **"Maybe!" => Illustrate the wisdom of non-judgement**<br/>
Take time to be silent, to just BE. <br/> Meditate for 22 minutes twice per day. <br/>
Silently witness the intelligence within every living thing. Practice non-judgement. <br/>
<!-- I will put the Law of Pure Potentiality into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
  1. I will get in touch with the field of pure potentiality by taking time each day to be silent, to just BE. I will also sit alone in silent meditation at least twice a day for approximately 22 minutes in the morning and 22 minutes in the evening. 
  2. I will take time each day to interact with nature and to silently witness the intelligence within every living thing. I will sit silently and watch a sunset, or listen to the sound of the ocean or a stream, or simply smell the scent of a flower. In the ecstasy of my own silence, and by interacting with nature, I will enjoy the lire throb of ages, the field of pure potentiality and unlimited creativity.
  3. I will practice non-judgement. I will begin my day with this statement: "Today, I shall judge nothing that occurs, and reply "MAYBE!" to all opinion-seeking suggestions by others," and throughout the day I will remind myself not to judge. -->

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Look at Their Past <br/>
When choosing people to work and associate with, do not be hypnotized by their reputation or taken in by the surface image they try to project. <br/>
Instead, train myself to look deeper within them, to their past actions, to see their character. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Live the wonderful life that is in you" - Oscar Wilde <br/>

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm thankful:** to have a roof over my head.. <br/>

<!-- what is holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Things "Emotionally Intelligent People" **DO NOT DO**: <br/>
They DO NOT assume that the way they think and feel about a situation is the way it is in reality, nor how it will turn out in the end. <br/>
They recognize their emotions as responses, not accurate gauges, of what is going on. They accept that those responses may have to do with their own issues, rather than the objective situation at hand. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When or Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions/Reflections of the day?**

- [] Is something good or bad? Is this right or wrong? Ignore everything else. Focus only on my choices. <br/>
- [] What food have you never eaten but would really like to try? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
1. something only I can do;
2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:

2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->

<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

<!-- learn Read Code. Read lots of Code
  - to get better, ask myself:
    1. How would I have written that block of code? What would I do differently, now that I've seen another solution?
    2. What did I learn? How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past?
    3. How would I improve this code? If it's open source project where I am confident I have a better solution, DO IT!!!
    4. Write code in the author's style.
  - Write out my answer in personal journal;
  - explain, write down, sharing analysis can help to understand why I react to another person code
- DO NOT COPY & PASTE the code, take my time to understand it, or else I just imported a bug-factory!!! -->
<!-- learn write code, and not just as Assignment
  - work on personal project:
    1. give me a way to learn tools and tech not available at work
    2. make me more marketable
    3. gain tech skills and self-confidence when work on open source or local community project
    4. personal project demonstrate I am self-starter who never stop learning
   - it also force me to figure things out on my own
   - choose a personal project that I may fail, I need to fail to learn -->
<!-- learn work one-on-one with other developers any way I can
  - listen to other people
  - contribute to open source projects, pay attention to feedback I get from other developers:
  - what commonalities do I see in their criticisms? -->
<!-- learn learn technique, not tools
  - Focus on programming fundamentals ==> basic never change
  - pay attention to architecture than to programming
  - If there is only one way to do something, time for a reality check -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 35 (Sunday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today continue working on setup typeScript with React Native from scratch with simple "hello world" to make sure it works, and slowly build up a BentoApp and add dependencies one by one, debug error line by line if any. Try to master the workflow first. Do not rush and chase the pack. Do it at my own pace.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->

### BentoApp Development Work Flow [REBOOT]

- **With React Native + TypeScript**

```Typescript
//@filename: app.tsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import {
  Platform,
  StyleSheet,
  Text,
  View
} from 'react-native';
import SplashScreen from 'react-native-splash-screen'

const instructions = Platform.select({
  ios: 'Press Cmd+R to reload,\n' +
    'Cmd+D or shake for dev menu',
  android: 'Double tap R on your keyboard to reload,\n' +
    'Shake or press menu button for dev menu',
});

type Props = {};
export default class App extends Component<Props> {
  componentDidMount() {
    SplashScreen.hide();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.welcome}>
        Welcome React Native Learners!
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.instructions}>
          To get started, edit App.js
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.instructions}>
          {instructions}
        </Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#4F6D7A',
  },
  welcome: {
    fontSize: 20,
    textAlign: 'center',
    margin: 10,
    color: '#F5FCFF',
  },
  instructions: {
    textAlign: 'center',
    color: '#F5FCFF',
    marginBottom: 5,
  },
});
```

==============================================================================

### Software Installed

[React Native Splash Screen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-splash-screen)

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

=============================================================================

### Build a BentoApp

- Objective:
  - Displaying splash screen during response time from the server is an excellent way to interact with the user. But making a loading/splash screen becomes difficult when we want to practically use an animated loader, where we need to make extra efforts to write down its styling file. To overcome this problem, we use a bunch of predefined loaders from the react-spinners module.

1. File Structure:
   1. src directory (source of components)
      - assets directory (for images & other resources)
      - welcome/splashscreen directory (SplashScreen)
      - screens directory (for loginScreen & registerScreen [UI/UX])
      - drawerscreens directory (for HomeScreen & SettingScreen)
      - to add dashboard directory (dashboard)
   2. Wire Frame

![file structure2](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/IMG/PNG/learningImgs/file2.png "style=width:200 height: 200")

<h4 align="center">Project Logo</h4>

![project logo](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/IMG/GIF/bentoLogo.gif "style=width:50 height: 50")

1. Approach:

- Step 1: write some code in App.tsx, no need to make any other components for this project. For using the predefined spinners we need to import the 'loader' component from 'react-spinners'.
- Step 2: need to 'useState" to add a state to our functional component and 'useEffect' is also needed.

- Put your side-effect logic into the callback function, then use the dependencies argument to control when you want the side-effect to run. That's the sole purpose of useEffect().

![useEffect() Hook](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/IMG/PNG/learningImgs/file3.png "style=width:200 height: 200")

- [A Simple Explanation of React.useEffect()](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-useeffect-explanation/#1-useeffect-is-for-side-effects)
- [What is useState() in React ?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-usestate-in-react/)
- [useState and useEffect explained](https://medium.com/recraftrelic/usestate-and-useeffect-explained-cdb5dc252baf)

- Step 3 ==> Add a state isLoading which will indicate that splashscreen page is loading or not.
- Step 4 ==> Add a setTimeout() method inside useEffect to make the splash screen appear for a certain time period example: 5sec.
- Step 5 ==> use a custom CSS block to override its property and use it when isLoading is true example: page is still loading.

1. Git Branch

   1. main
    - setup folder & file
    - merge safe dependencies from branch 'testing'
   2. testing
      - test npm dependencies installed
      - playground for ideas
      - merge to branch 'main/splashscreen/loginscreen/ once error free
   3. SplashScreen
      - build splashscreen
   4. LoginScreen
      - build loginscreen

```bash
# steps taken to resolve emulator starting issue
#  re-install all the dependencies and made sure the project is using correct native packages?
# @filename:  ~/Desktop/COMPANY-WORK-SPACE/myLearnerFolder/BentoApp
rm -r node_modules
npm install

# @filename:  ~/Desktop/COMPANY-WORK-SPACE/myLearnerFolder/BentoApp
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build --refresh-dependencies
# so sad!! it won't work

# Android path not added to the environment
# First thing first, check if you have Android SDK already installed. And find out Folder\directory location of the Android SDK. You can find the SDK location from your Android Studio –> File > Settings > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK

# Normally the default location of Android SDK are –
# Linux: ~/Android/Sdk
# Mac: ~/Library/Android/sdk

# We can fix the issue by using the below steps –

# For this option, as a next step, We have to create a local.properties file so that we can point where the Android SDK is located. Hence Go to your React Native Project. And then Android. Create a file – local.properties .

# Once you create the local.properties file, add the Android SDK details based on the operating system that you have.
# For Linux
sdk.dir = /home/craftome_cj/Android/Sdk

# For Mac
sdk.dir = /Users/craftome_cj/Library/Android/sdk

# Make sure setting.gradle file present. The settings.gradle file, located in the root project directory, tells Gradle which modules it should include when building your app. This Settings.gradle just includes the module in your application. By default it will be ‘app’ module. If this file is not present, create the settings.gradle file and add the following.
include ':app'

# For Linux – 

# Open the ~/.bash_profile
gedit ~/.bash_profile

# Add the below variables. Then Save and close the file.
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->
