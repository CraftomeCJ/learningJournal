# What I Learned today?

##### Day 9 (Tuesday)) and today's focus mainly on doing Day 6 React Native setup and familiarize myself with the basics of React Native

- React Native is a new way to build mobile apps.
- It is a framework that allows you to build mobile apps using JavaScript.
- With React, I can make component using either classes or functions.
- class components essentially are function components
- class & function are standard template structure
- advantage of class, they make it easy to handle state
- function components have the ability to handle state too
- Janna recommend to try to avoid classes, and make full use of functions to create applications, they enhance reusability, and allow ease of hook implementations & testing
- Created my first component using class, and then converted it to a function component
- Use JSX element to create components with variables inside it
- import react, react native, community, core and native and export custom components
- practice on basic component "View", "Text", "StyleSheet", "Button"
- practice on Text component and Nested Text
- practice to build a button follow RN example
- understand the rules of JSX
- converting to TypeScript project by install TS package and dependencies
- setup and edit tsconfig.json and jest.config.js file to enable rename js file to tsx typescript file
- read List of different components in React
- read React List Components by Example
- read Introduction to React List Components
- read When should you use Class vs Function Components in React.js?

## What difficulties did I encounter?

1. While setting up ios & android simulator and emulator, face a minor connectivity issue with my android phone. error message "Could not load expo Network response timed out"

2. Expo-cli is installed but "-bash: expo: command not found" error message

3. "command not found: jest" error message

4. "No overload matches this call with styled components TypeScript" error message when I write a nested function components with View & StyleSheet

## How do I solve the issues?

1. After asking Mr Google, I found a few solutions:

- installed Android Studio
- turnoff my firewall
- setup Android Studio Emulator

2. I do this:

- npm install expo-cli
- then it installed run this command:
- npm install expo-cli --global

3. I fixed it by installing jest globally.

- npm install -g jest

4. last error of the night, too late to find a solution, will try again tomorrow.

## Room to improve?

- Put too much time on reading and researching on concepts, need to shorten the duration

- Continue to work on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it.

- Day 10 is continue to learn and practice on Day 7 notes of React Native concepts and at the same time practice on TypeScript projects.

- After completed day 7 & 8 React Native's notes, required to go back to build Udemy's Drag & Drop Project with TypeScript

- Learn to generate React Application that uses TypeScript [not done on day 9]

- Build React Components with TypeScript Interfaces for scalable features [not done on day 9]

## MY GOAL

#### Aim to practice by building many small projects with TypeScript then React Native to embed the concepts deeply

## Possible Project Work

1. I wished to create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket
5. A food & nutrition app that provide food portions in smaller sizes to stimulate reduction of food consumption and reduction of food waste
6. A wellness app that provides more scientifically proven and generally understood advices to a health diet
7. An app to provide a more balanced healthcare for the various developed nations
8. An advisor app based on blood test result
9. A multilingual recipe app that provides recipes and nutrition facts
