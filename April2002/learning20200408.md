# What I Learned today?

- Day 5 of apprenticeship and today's focus continue from yesterday mainly on TypeScript Functions and briefly touch on Object Types Classes & Interfaces.

- Practice on Call & Construct Signatures
- Revision heavily on Generic Functions
- Learn how to work with Constrained Values
- Practice on how to write Good Generic Functions
- Practice on Optional Parameters how it works in Callbacks
- Learn the difference on overloads & how to write good function overload
- Understand types like void, object, unknown, never
- Practice on how to destructed functions & when to use return type void
- Understand how Rest Parameter work with spread syntax

## What difficulties did I encounter?

1. Unfamiliar with ternary operators

2. Cannot grasp the concepts of Arrow Functions

## How do I solve the issues?

Over the weekend, I will practice on the above difficulties with resources link provided below to enforce my understanding of the concepts.

## Room to improve?

- Try to catch up with Day 4 & 5 notes over the weekend, currently lagging behind by 2 days of work.

- Still pushing hard to rememeber the logic of arrow functions & ternary operators

- Continue to work on the basics, its feature, workflows and how to use it.

- Day 6 is to learn and practice Object Types such as Classes & Interfaces 

- After completed classes & interfaces, will move on to Modules & Decorators on Sunday.

- Aim to practice by building of small projects with TypeScript and React Native soon.
