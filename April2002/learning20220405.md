# What I Learned today?

Day 2  of apprenticeship and today was heavy and tough to digest on new React Native Basic Concepts.
<br>
Since yesterday evening we were mainly assigned to familiarize with React Native and why it is good gor mobile apps development.
Reading up documentation on this trending tech stack is a good way to get a feel of the technology.
It is a JavaScript framework, works on cross platform with a native UI look and feel.

We are required to run a sample project and install node modules and run a starter app on ios stimulator, which is where i meet my first bottleneck.
After successfully installing node modules and running the starter app, we were able to see the simulator and the metro server.

After browsed through the folders and files, we are asked to understand package.json and package-lock.json and the entire React Native Project File Structure. In the morning, we continue to read up on the React Native project file structure and understand the different folders and files.

After daily standup with Anya & Janna in mid-morning, we continued to move to learn TypeScript 
and understand the different types of variables and functions.
Try to experience how typescript works and how it can be used to make your code more readable and maintainable.

This is where i met my second bottleneck, an unknown error from my linter showed up and IDE not showing the red underline error in the code.
Unfortunately, it is a new big concepts, i only managed to learn the core types with the help of a Udemy course "Understanding TypeScript - 2022 edition" and the help of the mentor Anya but still struggle to understand the concepts.

## What difficulties did I encounter?

1. After few installation of node module on react-native-stater project folder, i keep getting the same error message asking me to update cocoapods and try install again.
2. An unknown eslint error and IDE not showing up error red underline.

## How do I solve the issues?

1. After several try, I approach Anya for the rescue, and it was solved by  using sudo xcode-select --switch /Application/Xcode.app

2. After an afternoon of googling, unable to solve, I had tried disable all plugin in IDE and enable only the eslint plugin, but still getting the same error message.
I tried turned on plugin one by one, but to no valid.
I tried reinstall eslint and restart IDE, run an eslint init, uninstall eslint -g, reinstall eslint -g, and then run eslint --init, but still getting the same error message, in the end the only way I did was disable the eslint plugin but the mysterious red underline errors still failed to show up. Speechless...

## Room to improve?

I need to more time to understand the usage of  TypeScript .
Continue to learn the basics, its feature, workflows and how to use it.
Day 3 is continue to learn Functions as Types, "any" Types, Union Types, Function Types & Callbacks,
The "unknown" Types, The "never" Types etc...
To practice more by building small projects with TypeScript.
