# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in your life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude-->
- The Law of Least Effort: **"non-resistance"**<br />
  Accept people, situations and events as they occur. Take responsibility for my situation and for all events seen as problems. Relinquish the need to defend my point of view.

- Daily Law: **Better to be Attacked Than Ignored**<br />
  Make no distinction between kinds of attention--notoriety of any sort will bring you power. Better to be slandered and attacked then ignored.

- Quote of the Day:<br />
  "The best way to predict the future is to create it." - Abraham Lincoln

- **I'm grateful for** the opportunity to learn and grow today.

## Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
1. I want to learn more about React Native
2. I need to practice more using React Native & Typescript
3. I need to learn more about the React Native ecosystem
4. I will read about the React Native documentation often
5. I have to build a React Native mini practice project
6. I will be 1% better than yesterday

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to your Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->
1. I need to learn some Github feature to show image in readme file

# Personal Notes

1. Janna's VScode plugin recommendation to try out:

- dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets
- eamodio.gitlens
- VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode
- dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
- firsttris.vscode-jest-runner
- SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode

2. research zsh shell feature

- [zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)

3. Try out Janna's .zshrc config file, change path, backup original .zshrc file

- special note: . from the file name was remove for easier to open

### What I Learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about your personal growth and should be an essential part of your work journal. -->
#### Day 10 (Wednesday) and today's main focus is

Doing Day 7 React Native Flatlist component and practice Udemy's List Building with Styles exercise.

- revamping my learningJournal.md layout to give it a new work journal look`
- understand how to use FlatList component
- It is a performant interface for rendering a list of items
- understand how 'renderItem' & 'data' prop and how to apply it
- understand how to use 'keyExtractor' prop and purpose of using it
- found out that key prop is being use frequently and we can use map() to render each item, and 'key' prop assign to each item
- understand the importance of 'key' prop, how to implement it and style a list.
- Understand what is flatlist and how it form the list from the datasource
- how to add image in markdown readme in GitHub
- why Images in Markdown not showing when uploaded to Github
- Markdown to insert and display an image on GitHub repo
- Read about Key Things React Native Developers Should Know to Start Developing an Application
- Read about Understanding React's key prop
- understand What Are the 5 Key Concepts of React Native?
- find out how to use a keyExtractor with FlatList
- try on keyExtractor example in FlatList and how to use it
- read about when to use the keyExtractor prop in FlatList
- understanding React's key prop
- read an introduction to React PropTypes
- understanding the React Native bridge concept
-

### What difficulties did I encounter?
<!-- This is where I write down the problem I encountered-->
1. unable to add screenshot image to README.md on GitHub?
![Error Msg](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/imagenotshowerror.png height="60" width="60")

2. Images in Markdown not showing when uploaded to Github

3. "VirtualizedList: missing keys for items, make sure to specify a key property on an item or provide a custom keyExtractor" error
![Error Msg](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/virtualizelisterror.png height="60" width="60")

4. Unable to view remote branches in shell commands

<p align="left">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### How do I solve the issues?
<!-- This is where I write down the steps for solving the issues I had encountered -->
1. After asking Mr Google, I found a few solutions:

- use markdown image syntax ==> ![Alt text](url "Title" height="60" width="60")
- Alt-text - is an image alt attribute text url- It contains relative url or complete HTTP url
- I can resize an image in markdown readme in GitHub too by apply this syntax

```markdown
<img src="http://url/image.png" height="60" width="60" >
```

3. I do this:

- by using a keyExtractor with FlatList
- I have to choose a unique key prop, like an id or 'string'
- The keyExtractor falls back to using the index by default. But the warning will remain visible.

4. with the help of [How to list branches in Git?](https://www.jquery-az.com/list-branches-git/) & [How to List Remote Branches in Git](https://tecadmin.net/list-all-remote-branches-in-git/) guide, i managed to access remote branched via CLI commands

### Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write the the things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. During this time ask yourself;

=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Put too much time on reading and researching on concepts, need to shorten the duration

- Continue to work on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it.

- Day 11 is continue to learn and practice on Day 8 & 9 notes of React Native concepts and at the same time practice on TypeScript projects.

- Try to complete the Udemy's few practice projects with TypeScript

- Need to practice how to more efficiently timeboxing myself for task

- Required to be better in time management

### Miscellaneous
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->
So lucky.... sub-tasks seem completed today

### Monthly Experiment
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->
TBC
## MY GOAL
#### Aim to practice by building many small projects with TypeScript then React Native to embed the concepts deeply

## Possible Project Work

1. I wished to create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket
5. A food & nutrition app that provide food portions in smaller sizes to stimulate reduction of food consumption and reduction of food waste
6. A wellness app that provides more scientifically proven and generally understood advices to a health diet
7. An app to provide a more balanced healthcare for the various developed nations
8. An advisor app based on blood test result
9. A multilingual recipe app that provides recipes and nutrition facts
