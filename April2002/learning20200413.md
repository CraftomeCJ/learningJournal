# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in your life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude-->
- The Law of Least Effort: **"non-resistance"**<br />
  Accept people, situations and events as they occur. Take responsibility for my situation and for all events seen as problems. Relinquish the need to defend my point of view.

- Daily Law: **Better to be Attacked Than Ignored**<br />
  Make no distinction between kinds of attention--notoriety of any sort will bring you power. Better to be slandered and attacked then ignored.

- Quote of the Day:<br />
  "The best way to predict the future is to create it." - Abraham Lincoln

- **I'm grateful for** the opportunity to learn and grow today.

## Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
1. I want to learn more about React Native
2. I want to practice using React Native
3. I need to learn more about the React Native ecosystem
4. I will read about the React Native documentation
5. I have to build a React Native app

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to your Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->
1. I need to run a quick errand

# Personal Notes

### What I Learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about your personal growth and should be an essential part of your work journal. -->
#### Day 10 (Wednesday) and today's main focus is:

Doing Day 7 & 8 React Native concepts and familiarize with List Building with Styles and Navigating Users between Screens

- React Native is a new way to build mobile apps.
- It is a framework that allows you to build mobile apps using JavaScript.
- With React, I can make component using either classes or functions.
- class components essentially are function components
- class & function are standard template structure
- advantage of class, they make it easy to handle state
- function components have the ability to handle state too
- Janna recommend to try to avoid classes, and make full use of functions to create applications, they enhance reusability, and allow ease of hook implementations & testing
- Created my first component using class, and then converted it to a function component
- Use JSX element to create components with variables inside it
- import react, react native, community, core and native and export custom components
- practice on basic component "View", "Text", "StyleSheet", "Button"
- practice on Text component and Nested Text
- practice to build a button follow RN example
- understand the rules of JSX
- converting to TypeScript project by install TS package and dependencies
- setup and edit tsconfig.json and jest.config.js file to enable rename js file to tsx typescript file
- read List of different components in React
- read React List Components by Example
- read Introduction to React List Components
- read When should you use Class vs Function Components in React.js?

### What difficulties did I encounter?
<!-- This is where I write down the problem I encountered-->
1. While setting up ios & android simulator and emulator, face a minor connectivity issue with my android phone. error message "Could not load expo Network response timed out"
![alt text](https://unsplash.com/photos/HOK1J-UPnqc)

2. Expo-cli is installed but "-bash: expo: command not found" error message

3. "command not found: jest" error message

4. "No overload matches this call with styled components TypeScript" error message when I write a nested function components with View & StyleSheet

<p align="left">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### How do I solve the issues?
<!-- This is where I write down the steps for solving the issues I had encountered -->
1. After asking Mr Google, I found a few solutions:

- installed Android Studio
- turnoff my firewall
- setup Android Studio Emulator

2. I do this:

- npm install expo-cli
- then it installed run this command:
- npm install expo-cli --global

3. I fixed it by installing jest globally.

- npm install -g jest

4. last error of the night, too late to find a solution, will try again tomorrow.

### Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write the the things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. During this time ask yourself;

=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Put too much time on reading and researching on concepts, need to shorten the duration

- Continue to work on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it.

- Day 10 is continue to learn and practice on Day 7 notes of React Native concepts and at the same time practice on TypeScript projects.

- After completed day 7 & 8 React Native's notes, required to go back to build Udemy's Drag & Drop Project with TypeScript

- Learn to generate React Application that uses TypeScript [not done on day 9]

- Build React Components with TypeScript Interfaces for scalable features [not done on day 9]

### Miscellaneous
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->
So lucky.... no sub-tasks today

### Monthly Experiment
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

## MY GOAL

#### Aim to practice by building many small projects with TypeScript then React Native to embed the concepts deeply

## Possible Project Work

1. I wished to create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket
5. A food & nutrition app that provide food portions in smaller sizes to stimulate reduction of food consumption and reduction of food waste
6. A wellness app that provides more scientifically proven and generally understood advices to a health diet
7. An app to provide a more balanced healthcare for the various developed nations
8. An advisor app based on blood test result
9. A multilingual recipe app that provides recipes and nutrition facts
