# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in your life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude-->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of of Karma: **What goes around, comes around**<br/>
Every action generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind. <br/>
Choosing actions that bring happiness and success to others ensures the flow of happiness and success to me.

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Tailor My Flattery <br/>
Overt flattery can be effective but has its limits;<br/> it is too direct and obvious and looks bad to others. <br/>
Discreet flattery, tailored to the insecurities of my target, is much more powerful.<br/>

**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Good judgement comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgement." - Will Rogers

**I'm grateful for:** LIFE. I study very hard, I work very hard, and I play very hard. And I live LIFE to the fullest -- I believe LIFE loves the liver of it. I will lives and breathes LIFE.

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to your Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->
1. [x] Birthday Dinner @7.30pm

## Personal Notes

**Day 16 (Tuesday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today will be continue to work on doing Day 11 React Native concepts "State MManagement", keep practicing and try to apply the concepts to mini project to further familiarize at the same time troubleshooting TextStyleProps Type errors and apply layout props.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about your personal growth and should be an essential part of your work journal. -->
- Destructuring makes it easy to extract only what is needed.
- Add ScrollView primitive components to view whole list of output on RandomColorScreen
- Continue to practice on State Management by Generating Random Color
- Show Colours with a FlatList
- Try use the same concept to generate Random Number

**Principles: Destructuring Array & Objects, Lists, keys, Styling React using CSS, useState with FlatList**

1. Destructing Arrays
  - example old way of assigning array items to a variable:

```JavaScript
const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

// old way
const car = vehicles[0];
const truck = vehicles[1];
const suv = vehicles[2];
```

  - example new way of assigning array items to a variable:
  - with destructuring
  - important When destructuring arrays, the order that variables are declared is important.

```JavaScript
const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

const [car, truck, suv] = vehicles;

```

  - example destructuring shorthand with 'comma'

```JavaScript
const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

const [car,, suv] = vehicles;
```

  - example Destructuring comes in handy when a function returns an array:

```JavaScript
function calculate(a, b) {
  const add = a + b;
  const subtract = a - b;
  const multiply = a * b;
  const divide = a / b;

  return [add, subtract, multiply, divide];
}

const [add, subtract, multiply, divide] = calculate(4, 7);
```

2. Destructuring Object
  - example old way of using an object inside a function:

```JavaScript
const vehicleOne = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021, 
  color: 'red'
}

myVehicle(vehicleOne);

// old way
function myVehicle(vehicle) {
  const message = 'My ' + vehicle.type + ' is a ' + vehicle.color + ' ' + vehicle.brand + ' ' + vehicle.model + '.';
}
```

  - example new way of using an object inside a function:
  - With destructuring
  - important object properties do not have to be declared in a specific order.
  - We can even destructure deeply nested objects by referencing the nested object then using a colon and curly braces to again destructure the items needed from the nested object:

```JavaScript
const vehicleOne = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021, 
  color: 'red',
  registration: {
    city: 'Houston',
    state: 'Texas',
    country: 'USA'
  }
}

myVehicle(vehicleOne)

function myVehicle({ model, registration: { state } }) {
  const message = 'My ' + model + ' is registered in ' + state + '.';
}
```

3. React Lists
  - To render lists with some type of loop.
  - JavaScript map() array method is generally the preferred method.
  - example render all of the cars from our garage:
  - note when you run this code in the create-react-app, it will work but I will receive a VirtualizeList warning that there is no "key" provided for the list items.

```JavaScript
function Car(props) {
  return <li>I am a { props.brand }</li>;
}

function Garage() {
  const cars = ['Mercedes', 'BMW', 'Audi'];
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Who lives in my garage?</h1>
      <ul>
        {cars.map((car) => <Car brand={car} />)}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<Garage />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

4. keys
  - are used to identify which item in an array is being rendered.
  - allow React to keep track of elements
  - This way, if an item is updated or removed, only that item will be re-rendered instead of the entire list.
  - note Keys need to be unique to each sibling. But they can be duplicated globally.
  - important The key should be a unique ID assigned to each item. As a last resort, you can use the array index as a key.
  - example refactor our aforementioned example to include keys

```JavaScript
function Car(props) {
  return <li>I am a { props.brand }</li>;
}

function Garage() {
  const cars = [
    {id: 1, brand: 'Mercedes'},
    {id: 2, brand: 'BMW'},
    {id: 3, brand: 'Audi'}
  ];
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Who lives in my garage?</h1>
      <ul>
        {cars.map((car) => <Car key={car.id} brand={car.brand} />)}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<Garage />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

4. Styling React Using CSS
   1. Inline Styling
      - To style an element with the inline style attribute, the value must be a JavaScript object:
      - example Insert an object with the styling information:
      - important In JSX, JavaScript expressions are written inside curly braces, and since JavaScript objects also use curly braces, the styling in the example above is written inside two sets of curly braces {{}}.

```JavaScript
const Header = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1 style={{color: "red"}}>Hello Style!</h1>
      <p>Add a little style!</p>
    </>
  );
}
```
    2. camelCased Property Names
       - the inline CSS is written in a JavaScript object, properties with hyphen separators, like background-color, must be written with camel case syntax:
       - example Use backgroundColor instead of background-color:

```JavaScript
const Header = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1 style={{backgroundColor: "lightblue"}}>Hello Style!</h1>
      <p>Add a little style!</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

    3. JavaScript Object
       - can also create an object with styling information, and refer to it in the style attribute:
       - example Create a style object named myStyle:

```JavaScript
const Header = () => {
  const myStyle = {
    color: "white",
    backgroundColor: "DodgerBlue",
    padding: "10px",
    fontFamily: "Sans-Serif"
  };
  return (
    <>
      <h1 style={myStyle}>Hello Style!</h1>
      <p>Add a little style!</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

2. CSS Stylesheet
    1. You can write your CSS styling in a separate file, just save the file with the .css file extension, and import it in your application.

3. CSS Modules
   1. Another way of adding styles to your application is to use CSS Modules.
   2. CSS Modules are convenient for components that are placed in separate files.
   3. important The CSS inside a module is available only for the component that imported it, and you do not have to worry about name conflicts.
   4. Create the CSS module with the .module.css extension, example: my-style.module.css.

```JavaScript
//my-style.module.css:
.bigblue {
  color: DodgerBlue;
  padding: 40px;
  font-family: Sans-Serif;
  text-align: center;
}
```
Import the stylesheet in your component:

```JavaScript
//Car.js:
import styles from './my-style.module.css'; 

const Car = () => {
  return <h1 className={styles.bigblue}>Hello Car!</h1>;
}

export default Car;
```

Import the component in your application:

```JavaScript
//index.js:
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Car from './Car.js';

ReactDOM.render(<Car />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Exercise of the Day

[x] **Challenge:** Create new ColorScreen, and try to add the color label under the color square

1. Challenge Questions:
  1. Create a new screen ColorScreen and add navigation to the ColorScreen from the HomeScreen

  2. Add button, flatlist and state to the ColorScreen 

  3. Try to understand how the state changes according to the clicking of button

  4. Understand how to setState. Never change the state directly, should always use setColors

  5. Try to add the color label under the color square.

**Three questions:**
What piece of data inside this application is changing?  ==> colors
What type of data is it? Is it a number, a string, an object, or an array? ==> array of strings
What is the starting value of that piece of data? ==> []

```JavaScript
//example of a Generating Random Color
import {
	StyleSheet,
	Text,
	View,
	Button,
	FlatList,
	ScrollView,
} from 'react-native';
import React, { useState } from 'react';

//add the color label under the
const RandomColorScreen: React.FC = () => {
	const [color, setColor] = useState<{ name: string; color: string }[]>([
		{ name: 'yellow', color: 'yellow' },
	]);
	//console.log(color);

	//call the 'randomRgb' function here
	return (
		<View>
			<Button
				title='Add a Color'
				onPress={() => {
					setColor([...color, randomRgb()]);
				}}
			/>
			<ScrollView>
				<FlatList
					keyExtractor={(item) => item.name}
					data={color}
					renderItem={({ item }) => {
						return (
							<View style={styles.listStyle}>
								<View
									style={{
										height: 100,
										width: 100,
										backgroundColor: item.color,
									}}
								/>
								<Text>{item.name}</Text>
							</View>
						);
					}}
				/>
			</ScrollView>
		</View>
	);
};

//To generate the random color
const randomRgb = () => {
	const red = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
	const green = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
	const blue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);

	return {
		name: `rgb(${red}, ${green}, ${blue})`,
		color: `rgb(${red}, ${green}, ${blue})`,
	};
};

export default RandomColorScreen;

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
	listStyle: {
		flexDirection: 'row',
		justifyContent: 'flex-start',
		alignItems: 'center',
		paddingTop: 10,
		paddingBottom: 5,
	},
});
```

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 
ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Put too much time on reading and researching on new concepts, practice to shorten the duration by time-boxing to 60 minutes.

- Continue to work on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it.

- Day 16 is continue to learn and practice on React Native concepts and at the same time work on TypeScript projects.

- Try to apply what I learn on different components to make some fireworks

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Miscellaneous
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

## Monthly Experiment
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

## MY GOAL

### Aim to practice by building many small projects with TypeScript then React Native in hope to embed the concepts deeply

#### Possible Project Work

**I wished to:** <br/>

1. Create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket
5. A food & nutrition app that provide food portions in smaller sizes to stimulate reduction of food consumption and reduction of food waste
6. A wellness app that provides more scientifically proven and generally understood advices to a health diet
7. An app to provide a more balanced healthcare for the various developed nations
8. An wellness and diet advisor app based on blood test result.
9. A bookstore app that provides a unified platform for all kinds of books and magazines.
10. A multilingual recipe app that provides recipes and nutrition facts to promote eat well eat healthy Southeast-Asia Cuisine.
11. Build a Chatbot that can provide a personalized service to the user based on the user's input
