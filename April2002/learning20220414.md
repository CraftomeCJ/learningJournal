# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in your life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude-->
**Law of Life:** <br />
The Law of Intention and Desire: <br />  
Inherent in every intention and desire is the mechanics for its fulfillment. **Make a list of desires**. Trust that when things don't seem to go my way, there is a reason.

**Daily Law:** <br />
View the World as a Vast Interconnected Palace <br />
Because humans are social creatures by nature, power depends on social interaction and circulation. <br/>
To make myself powerful, place myself at the center of things, make myself more accessible, seek out old allies and make new ones, force myself into more and more different circles.

**Quote of the Day:** <br />
"Be weird, be transparent, be authentic, be myself" - Ron Tite

**I'm grateful for:** my heart, which I can feel beating.

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
1. To be 1% better than yesterday
2. To understand and practice on RN Navigation
3. Play around coding buttons, touchableOpacity, onPress props
4. Understand how to navigate around the screens. 
5. complete Day 8 Challenge Questions
6. figure out how to create a React Component

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to your Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->
1. TBC

## Personal Notes

 **Day 11 (Thursday) and today's main focus:**

## What I had Learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about your personal growth and should be an essential part of your work journal. -->
Doing Day 8 & 9 React Native concepts with practice and challenge questions to familiarize with Navigating Users between Screens Building Reusable Components.

1. **Button, TouchableOpacity Stack Navigation**

- *Button*
  - Very simple component for showing a button and detecting a press
  - onPress - Handler to be call when user taps the button
  - title - Text to display inside the button
  - color - Color of the text (iOS), or background color of the button (Android).
- *TouchableOpacity*
  - Highly customizable component that can detect a press on just about any kind of element
  - onPress - Handler to be call when user taps the button
  - style - can apply the custom styling.
- Stack Navigator
  - Stack Navigator provides a way for your app to transition between screens where each new screen is placed on top of a stack.
  - Stack navigator shows one of our components and passes in that props object
  - There are a lot of properties exist inside the props object.
  - Use navigation property object added in specifically by React Native library
- React Native is a new way to build mobile apps.

## Exercise of the Day

[x] **Challenge:** List Building - with Style Exercise

1. Challenge Questions:
   1. Create a Demo folder with index.tsx and style.ts file in the src -> screens -> dashboard folder.
   2. Export Demo and import on AppStack.tsx
   3. adding Demo = "Demo" in de navigation-name.ts
   4. Create a stack.screen for the demo
   5. Add the button on the home -> index.tsx

## What difficulties did I encounter and How do I solve the issues?
<!-- This is where I write down the problem and write down the steps for solving the issues I had encountered-->
**Project difficulties:**

1. Try to covert the list to a table format by setting flex direction to row and set the width for both item. Face a issue that make that table header. Original plan is to make it inside the flatlist.

- At the end found that it is unable to return two view without a wrapper. So I am creating header outside the flatlist.
   ![solution image4](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/flatlistsolution4.png "style=width:200 height: 200")

2. Try to combining two or more style in one component.

   - Do a research and solve the problem by using [] to wrap both style.

```typescript
   style = { [styles.first, styles.second ] }
```

1. Button didn't provide style element.

- Using View to do the styling.
   ![solution image4](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/flatlistsolution4.png "style=width:200 height: 200")

**Other difficulties:**

1. While setting up ios & android simulator and emulator, face a minor connectivity issue with my android phone. error message "Could not load expo Network response timed out"
  After asking Mr Google, I found a few solutions:
   - installed Android Studio
   - turnoff my firewall
   - setup Android Studio Emulator
![Error Msg](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/Screenshot1.png "style=width:200 height: 200")

1. Expo-cli is installed but "-bash: expo: command not found" error message
  I do this:
   - npm install expo-cli
   - then it installed run this command:
   - npm install expo-cli --global
![Error Msg](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/Screenshot1.png "style=width:200 height: 200")

3. "command not found: jest" error message
  I fixed it by installing jest globally.

   - npm install -g jest
![Error Msg](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/Screenshot1.png "style=width:200 height: 200")

1. "No overload matches this call with styled components TypeScript" error message when I write a nested function components with View & StyleSheet

  Unresolved, required to try again.

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write the the things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. During this time ask yourself;

=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Put too much time on reading and researching on concepts, need to shorten the duration

- Continue to work on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it.

- Day 10 is continue to learn and practice on Day 7 notes of React Native concepts and at the same time practice on TypeScript projects.

- After completed day 7 & 8 React Native's notes, required to go back to build Udemy's Drag & Drop Project with TypeScript

- Learn to generate React Application that uses TypeScript [not done on day 9]

- Build React Components with TypeScript Interfaces for scalable features [not done on day 9]

## Miscellaneous
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

## Monthly Experiment
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

## MY GOAL

### Aim to practice by building many small projects with TypeScript then React Native to embed the concepts deeply

### Possible Project Work

I wished to:

1. Create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket
5. A food & nutrition app that provide food portions in smaller sizes to stimulate reduction of food consumption and reduction of food waste
6. A wellness app that provides more scientifically proven and generally understood advices to a health diet
7. An app to provide a more balanced healthcare for the various developed nations
8. An advisor app based on blood test result
9. A multilingual recipe app that provides recipes and nutrition facts
