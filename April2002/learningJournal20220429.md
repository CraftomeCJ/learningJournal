# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude-->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Detachment: **"This too, will pass!"** <br/>
Recognize the fact of impermanence. <br/>
Allow myself and others the freedom to be who they are. Do not force solutions -- allow solutions to spontaneously emerge <br/>
Uncertainty is essential, and my path to freedom. <br/>

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Cultivate an Air of Unpredictability <br/>
In the end, the more capricious I appear, the more respect I will garner. Only the terminally subordinate act in a predictable manner. <br/>
Strategically reveal my human side. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Life can be much boarder once you discover one simple fact: <br/>
Everything around you that you call "LIFE" was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, <br/>
you can influence it, you can build your own things other people can use." - Steve Jobs

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm grateful that:** I have food, water, and security as I wake up today. These are wonderful blessings to have.

<!-- what is holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Subconscious Behaviour that are Keeping Me from Having The Life I Want:
<br/>
I try to change other people, situations and things (or I just complain/get upset about them) when anger === self-recognition. <br/>
Most negative emotional reactions are myself identifying a disassociated aspect of myself. <br/>
My "shadow selves" are the part of me that at some point were conditioned to believe I am "not okay", so I suppressed them and have done everything in my power not to acknowledge them. <br/>
I don't dislike these parts of myself, though. So when I see somebody else displaying one of these traits, it infuriating, not because I dislike it, but because I have to fight my desire to fully integrate it into my whole consciousness. <br/> The things I love about others are the things I love about myself. <br/>
The things I hate about others are the things I cannot see in myself. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When or Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions of the day?**

- [x] What problem do I want to solve? <br/>
- [x] What am I building? <br/>

==============================================================================

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying -->

<!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
  1. something only I can do;
  2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
  1. Anyone can do it
  2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->
<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->
## **To be 1% better than yesterday!!**

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Had make good progress on practice to time-boxing my task to 90 minutes per self-assigned task.

- Continue to work on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it with some CSS fundamentals.

- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.

- Day 27 is continue to catch up on task that in complete from last week.

- Practice more to have better understanding of the useState & useReducer with other tutorials.

- Add one more column for technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- add one more column for non-technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- To learn and master better file management on using .gif to showcase course's challenge work and .png folder for error and warning messages display.

==============================================================================

## MY GOAL for learning React Native

### Aim to practice by building many small projects with TypeScript then React Native to embed the concepts deeply

==============================================================================

#### Possible Project Work

**I wished to:** <br/>

1. Create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket
5. A food & nutrition app that provide food portions in smaller sizes to stimulate reduction of food consumption and reduction of food waste
6. A wellness app that provides more scientifically proven and generally understood advices to a health diet
7. An app to provide a more balanced healthcare for the various developed nations
8. An wellness and diet advisor app based on blood test result.
9. A bookstore app that provides a unified platform for all kinds of books and magazines.
