# What I Learned today?

- Day 3  of apprenticeship and today's focus  mainly on  React Native Basic Concepts:

- Revision on Everyday Types;
- Browser through Native React Function Types

- Today  were mainly on  reviewing Object and Arrays Types, playing it around on IDE.

- Tried to understand how to working with Tuples and Enums.

- Understand enum types can be all-uppercase or all-uppercase snake case.
- Understand enum types case convention are not fixed depend on dev team  code styling.
- understand when new, better to follow existing way even have better way.

- What is 'any' type?

- How to apply Union & Literal Types.

- Have a brief look at Type Aliases  and Type Guards and Function Type.

## What difficulties did I encounter?

1. An unknown eslint error and IDE not showing up error red underline carried forward from yesterday.

## How do I solve the issues?

1. ESlint config file removed error:
   - After another afternoon of googling, finally found a solution to solve, it was caused by some configuration errors in Vscode setting.json file.
   - AFter deleting a few line of unnecessary code, it worked.

## Room to improve?

Try to catch up with Day 3 notes, currently lagging behind by 1 days work.
I need to push on to understand the usage of Enums, Union & Literal Types .
Continue to work on the basics, its feature, workflows and how to use it.
Day 4 is continue to learn and practice Functions such as Types, "any" Types, Union Types, Function Types & Callbacks,
The "unknown" Types, The "never" Types, Arrow function, Generic function.
Aim to practice with building of small projects with first TypeScript then React Native .
