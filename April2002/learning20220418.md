# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in your life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude-->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of of Detachment: **"This too, will pass"**<br/>
Recognize the fact of impermanence <br/>
Allow myself and others the freedom to be who they are. Do not force solutions -- allow solutions to spontaneously emerge. <br/>
Uncertainty is essential, and my path to freedom.

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Create a Cultlike Following <br/>
People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. <br/> Become the focal point of such desire by offering them a cause, a new faith to follow. In the absence of organized religion and grand causes, your new belief system will bring my untold power.

**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Excuses are the rocks, where our dreams are crushed" - Tim Fargo

**I'm grateful for:** giving me another chance to make my life better today.

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
 -->
1. [] To be 1% better than yesterday
2. [] complete the required training and submit my Full Time Role Application. I will also take on additional work project to demonstrate my readiness to shoulder more responsibility.
3. [] I've have worked as an Full Stack Developer Intern for 4 months, and will showcase some of my work in the next month. And, my company is looking to take on another software developer at the end of 6 months internship.
4. [] I want to keep learning and challenging myself as I progress in my career.
5. [] I will take on 1 additional training project every 2 weeks, complete the required training with 7 weeks, and ask for a job status conversion within 5 months.
6. [] 5 daily task list here

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to your Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->
1. [] TBC

## Personal Notes

**Day 14 (Sunday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Continue to work on doing Day 9 React Native concepts, keep practicing and try out some online tutorials to further familiarize

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about your personal growth and should be an essential part of your work journal. -->
- understand what write here
- do what write here
- read what write here

1. **Principles:**

- Reusable Custom Component
  - write something
<br/>

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Exercise of the Day

[x] **Challenge:** challenge header

1. Challenge Questions:
   1. write something
![solution image1](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/solutionimage.png "style=width:200 height: 200")

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## What difficulties did I encounter and How do I solve the issues?
<!-- This is where I write down the problem and write down the steps for solving the issues I had encountered-->
<!-- example 1. While setting up ios & android simulator and emulator, face a minor connectivity issue with my android phone. error message "Could not load expo Network response timed out"
  After asking Mr Google, I found a few solutions:
   - installed Android Studio
   - turnoff my firewall
   - setup Android Studio Emulator
![Error Msg](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/Screenshot1.png "style=width:200 height: 200") -->
**Project difficulties:** <br/>

1. define problem here
   ![problemScreenshots](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/problemScreenshots.png "style=width:200 height: 200")

- solution steps here
   ![solutionSteps](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/solutionSteps.png "style=width:200 height: 200")
<!-- can include some codes for future use -->
```typescript
   style = { [styles.first, styles.second ] }
```

## What other issues trying to resolve? <br/>

1. define problem here
![ErrorImagehere](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/errorimage.png "style=width:200 height: 200")
  After some research, I found some solutions:
   - define solution here

  ```javascript
  git push origin --delete showsolution/codes
  ```

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Put too much time on reading and researching on new concepts, practice to shorten the duration by time-boxing to 60 minutes.

- Continue to work on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it.

- Day 15 is continue to learn and practice on Day 8 & 9 notes of React Native concepts and at the same time work on TypeScript projects.

- more reflection here

## Miscellaneous
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

## Monthly Experiment
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

## MY GOAL

### Aim to practice by building many small projects with TypeScript then React Native to embed the concepts deeply

#### Possible Project Work

**I wished to:** <br/>

1. Create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket
5. A food & nutrition app that provide food portions in smaller sizes to stimulate reduction of food consumption and reduction of food waste
6. A wellness app that provides more scientifically proven and generally understood advices to a health diet
7. An app to provide a more balanced healthcare for the various developed nations
8. An wellness and diet advisor app based on blood test result.
9. A bookstore app that provides a unified platform for all kinds of books and magazines.
10. A multilingual recipe app that provides recipes and nutrition facts to promote eat well eat healthy Southeast-Asia Cuisine.
11. Build a Chatbot that can provide a personalized service to the user based on the user's input
