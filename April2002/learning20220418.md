# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in your life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude-->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of of Giving<br/>
Today, bring whomever I encounter a gift: a compliment or flower.<br/>
Gratefully receive gifts. Keep wealth circulating by giving and receiving care, affection, appreciation and love</br>

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Startle the Snakes <br/>
As the Chinese say, beat the grass to startle the snakes. <br />

**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Always be a first-rate version of yourself, instead of a second-rate version of somebody else." - Judy Garland

**I'm grateful for:** always this moment, the now, no matter what form it takes.

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
 -->
1. [x] To be 1% better than yesterday
2. [] To complete the required training and submit Full Time Role Application. I will also take on additional work project to demonstrate my readiness to shoulder more responsibility.
3. [] I've have studied as an Full Stack Developer Intern for 4 months, and will showcase some of my demo in the next month. And, my company is looking to take on another software developer at the end of 6 months internship.
4. [] I want to keep learning and challenging myself as I progress in my career.
5. [] I will take on 1 additional training project every 2 weeks, complete the required training within 7 weeks, and ask for a job status conversion within 5 months.
6. [x] To finish Section 6 State Management in React Component VID 41-44
7. [x] explore more about useState, this is react, but the concept is the same for react native:
<https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_usestate.asp>
8. Try to apply what you practice in w3schools to your own react-native-starter project.
9. [x] To complete useState concept and practice question
10. [x] To continue practice and building on different reusable component
11. [] To finish up TextStyleProps.tsx component
12. read React guides to refresh memory:
1. [x]The Basic
2. [x]Environment Setup
3. [x]Workflow

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to your Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->
1. [] TBC

## Personal Notes

**Day 15 (Monday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today will be working on doing Day 10 React Native concepts "State MManagement", keep practicing and try out some online mini project to further familiarize at the same time troubleshooting TextStyleProps Type errors.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about your personal growth and should be an essential part of your work journal. -->
- Lifecycle of a program using setState Hook
  1. App starts up
  2. We navigate to the counterScreen. 'counter' piece of state is initialized ==> counter: 0
  3. User taps on the 'Increase' button, and the 'onPress' callbacks runs
  4. 'onPress' calls 'setCounter', and updates its value
  5. After a very brief pause, React automatically 'rerender' or re-runs the COunterScreen component
  6. CounterScreen was already ran once! The state variable 'counter' is not initialized again
  7. 'counter' now has & updated value of '1'==> counter: 1
  8. We return some JSX that references the updated 'counter' variable
- We are using function-based state in a functional component. React also has class-based components that have access to state
- We never directly modify a state variable. React doesn't detect this change! Only use the 'setter' function
- We can name the state variable anything we wish
- We can track any kind of data that changes over time - a number, string, array of objects, etc
- When a component is re-rendered, all of its children get re-rendered too
- A state variable can be passed to a child component! At that point, the state variable is now being used as props.
- What is a Hook?
  - Hooks are a new way to write state management in React.
  - allow us to 'hook' into React features such as state and lifecycle methods
  - I must import Hooks from react
  - we use 'useState' to keep track of the app state
  - Hooks Rules:
    1. can only be called inside React function components`
    2. can only be called at the top level of a function component
    3. cannot be conditional
- Hooks will not work in React class components

1. **Principles: State in Component, Screen Boilerplate, State in Action**

- State in Component
  - Props ==> System to pass data from a parent to a child component
  - State ==> System to track a piece of data that will change over time. If that data changes, our app will "rerender" the component.
<br/>

- Screen Boilerplate:
    1. **Import useState**
    2. To use 'useState' Hook, we first need to import it into our component.

```JavaScript
import React, {useState} from 'react';
```

    3. **Initialize useState Hook**
    4. Initialize our state by calling 'useState' and passing in initial value and returns two values:
       1. The Current state => first value 'color'
       2. A function that updates the state. => second value 'setColor'
       3. We set the initial state to an empty string => useState('')
    5. These names are variables so we can named anything we like so long other engineer can understand it.

```JavaScript
import React, {useState} from 'react';

function FavoriteColor() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState('');
}
```

    6. **Read State**
    7. We can now include our state anywhere in our component
    8. we can us e state variable in the rendered component like example below

```JavaScript
import React, {useState} from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button } from 'react-native';

function FavoriteColor() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState('red');

return (
    <View>
      <Text>
        My favorite color is {color}!
        </Text>
      </View>
)
}
export default FavoriteColor;

const styles = StyleSheet.create({});
```

    8. **Update State**
    9.  We should NEVER directly update the state ie: color = 'red' <== is not allowed
    10. we can use a button to update the state like example below

```JavaScript
import React, {useState} from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button } from 'react-native';

function FavoriteColor() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState('red');

return (
    <View>
      <Text>
        My favorite color is {color}!
        </Text>
      <Button
        title="Green"
        onPress={() => {
          setColor('green')
        }}
      />
      </View>
)
}
export default FavoriteColor;

const styles = StyleSheet.create({});
```

    11. **What can State Hold?**
    12. it can used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, any any combination of these types.
    13. for example we can create multiple state Hooks:

```JavaScript
import React, {useState} from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button } from 'react-native';

function FavoriteCar() {
  const [car, setCar] = useState('Rolls Royce');
  const [model, setModel] = useState('Phantom');
  const [year, setYear] = useState('1935');
  const [color, setColor] = useState('silver');

return (
    <View>
      <Text style={styles.textStyle}>
        My favorite car is {color}, {car}, {model} made in {year}!
        </Text>
      <Button
        title="red"
        onPress={() => {
          setColor('red')
        }}
      />
      </View>
)
}

export default FavoriteCar;

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  textStyle: {
    fontSize: 30
  }
});

```

    14. example a single Hook that holds an object:

```JavaScript
import React, {useState} from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button } from 'react-native';

function FavoriteCar() {
  const [car, setCar] = useState({
    brand: 'Rolls Royce',
    model: 'Phantom',
    year: '1935',
    color: 'silver'
});

return (
    <View>
      <Text style={styles.textStyle}>
        My favorite car is {car.brand}, It is a {car.color}, {car.model} made in {year}!
        </Text>
      <Button
        title="red"
        onPress={() => {
          setColor('red')
        }}
      />
      </View>
)
}

export default FavoriteCar;

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  textStyle: {
    fontSize: 30
  }
});
```

## Exercise of the Day

[x] **Challenge:** React Native useState

1. Create a new screen CounterScreen and add navigation to the CounterScreen from the HomeScree
2. Add button, text and state to the CounterScreen
3. Try to understand how the state changes according to the clicking of buttons
4. Understand how to setState. Never change the state directly
![solution image1](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/solutionimage.png "style=width:200 height: 200")

**Three questions:**

  1. What piece of data inside this application is changing?
    ==> variable changed
  2. What type of data is it? Is it a number, a string, an object, or an array?
    ==> define the data Type
  3. What is the starting value of that piece of data?
    set a starting value

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Put too much time on reading and researching on new concepts, practice to shorten the duration by time-boxing to 60 minutes.

- Continue to work on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it.

- Day 16 is continue to learn and practice on React Native 'State' management concepts and at the same time  continue to work on TypeScript fundamental.

## Miscellaneous
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

## Monthly Experiment
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

## MY GOAL

### Aim to practice by building many small projects with TypeScript then React Native to embed the concepts deeply

#### Possible Project Work

**I wished to:** <br/>

1. Create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket
5. A food & nutrition app that provide food portions in smaller sizes to stimulate reduction of food consumption and reduction of food waste
6. A wellness app that provides more scientifically proven and generally understood advices to a health diet
7. An app to provide a more balanced healthcare for the various developed nations
8. An wellness and diet advisor app based on blood test result.
9. A bookstore app that provides a unified platform for all kinds of books and magazines.
10. A multilingual recipe app that provides recipes and nutrition facts to promote eat well eat healthy Southeast-Asia Cuisine.
11. Build a Chatbot that can provide a personalized service to the user based on the user's input
