# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude-->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Giving: **Give, thou shalt Receive** <br/>
Today, bring whomever I encounter a gift: a smile, a compliment or flower.<br/>
Gratefully receive gifts. Keep wealth circulating by giving and receiving care, affection, appreciation and love</br>

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Enter Action with Boldness <br/>
Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. <br/>
Any mistakes I commit through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. <br/>

<!-- What some wise old man said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Your choices are made in a moment, but their consequences will transcend a lifetime" - MJ DeMarco

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm grateful that:** I'm looking forward to the future and feeling grateful for the past everyday.

<!-- what is holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:**
Subconscious Behaviour that are Keeping Me from Having The Life I Want:
<br/>
I needlessly create problems and crises in my life because I'm afraid of actually living it. <br/>
The pattern of unnecessarily creating crises in my life is actually an avoidance technique. <br/>
It distracts me from actually having to be vulnerable or held accountable for whatever it is I'm afraid of. <br/>
I'm never upset for the reason I think I am: <br/>
At the core of my desire to create a problem is simply the fear of being who I'm and living the life I want. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
**Reflection of the day?**

- [x] Each choice sets a precedent -- and when I make the same wrong choice several times in a row, it becomes my standard modus operandi. <br/>
- [x] Each time I faced with a decision between exerting self-control and taking it easy, always remind myself that the choice I'm making today doesn't affect the present moment alone. It can (and often will) reverberate for many years or even decades into the future. <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying
 -->
 <!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!-- Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
  1. something only I can do;
  2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!-- What is Low Leverage Activities:
  1. Anyone can do it
  2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->
<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->
## I want to be 1% better than yesterday!!

<!-- Work => 3 tasks -->
<!-- To identify my three highest-leverage activities in my work, 
first => make a list ==> capture all of the tasks I'm responsible for in my job od a typical month. 
second ask myself => if I could only do one thing on that list all day long, ==> which item on the list would add the most value to my company?
Third ask myself => the same question ==> If I could do only one more thing on your list of key tasks, which would be the second activity that contributes the most value to my company?
last ask myself again ==> ask yourself what the third most important task is.

## Personal Notes

**Day 22 (Monday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today will be working on Day 14 React Native State Management to learn how to manage state with reducers and try to refactor my Day 13 code to cleaner code with "keyof" and "typeof"

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
1. SquareScreen App works right now - we could leave it as-is! But we could make it slightly better...
2. We have 3 separate pieces of useState
3. For SquareScreen app, these 3 piece of state are extremely related
4. There is a precise set of well-known ways in which we update these values
5. This makes 3 & 4 "state" a great candidate for being managed by a 'reducer'
6. What is 'Reducer'?? <== is actually a FunctionThatManagesChangesToAnObject
   1. Some fancy name
   2. Function that gets called with two objects
   3. Argument #1 ==> object that has all of out state in it 
      (example: {red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0})
   4. Argument #2 ==> object that describes the update we want to make 
      (example: {colorToChange: 'red', amount: 15})
   5. Look at Argument #2 and use it to decide how to change Argument #1
   6. important = Two technicalities
      - (1) We never change Argument #1 directly
      - (2) We must always return a value to be used as Argument #1

**Principles: Context**

- Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
1. When to Use Context
  - Context is designed to share data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language
  - example:

```JavaScript
//manually thread through a "theme" prop in order to style the Button component:
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Toolbar theme="dark" />;
  }
}

function Toolbar(props) {
  // The Toolbar component must take an extra "theme" prop
  // and pass it to the ThemedButton. This can become painful
  // if every single button in the app needs to know the theme
  // because it would have to be passed through all components.
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton theme={props.theme} />
    </div>
  );
}

class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Button theme={this.props.theme} />;
  }
}
```

- Using context, we can avoid passing props through intermediate elements:

```JavaScript
// Context lets us pass a value deep into the component tree
// without explicitly threading it through every component.
// Create a context for the current theme (with "light" as the default).
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Use a Provider to pass the current theme to the tree below.
    // Any component can read it, no matter how deep it is.
    // In this example, we're passing "dark" as the current value.
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
        <Toolbar />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}

// A component in the middle doesn't have to
// pass the theme down explicitly anymore.
function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton />
    </div>
  );
}

class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
  // Assign a contextType to read the current theme context.
  // React will find the closest theme Provider above and use its value.
  // In this example, the current theme is "dark".
  static contextType = ThemeContext;
  render() {
    return <Button theme={this.context} />;
  }
}
```

2. Before You Use Context
   - Primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels.
   - note Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.
   - important If only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.
- example

```JavaScript
//consider a Page component that passes a user 
//and avatarSize prop several levels down so that deeply nested Link 
//and Avatar components can read it:

<Page user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<PageLayout user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<NavigationBar user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<Link href={user.permalink}>
  <Avatar user={user} size={avatarSize} />
</Link>
```

- One way to solve this issue without context is to pass down the Avatar component itself so that the intermediate components don’t need to know about the user or avatarSize props:
- example

```JavaScript
function Page(props) {
  const user = props.user;
  const userLink = (
    <Link href={user.permalink}>
      <Avatar user={user} size={props.avatarSize} />
    </Link>
  );
  return <PageLayout userLink={userLink} />;
}

// Now, we have:
<Page user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<PageLayout userLink={...} />
// ... which renders ...
<NavigationBar userLink={...} />
// ... which renders ...
{props.userLink}
```

  - With this change, only the top-most Page component needs to know about the Link and Avatar components’ use of user and avatarSize.
  - note This inversion of control can make your code cleaner in many cases by reducing the amount of props you need to pass through your application and giving more control to the root components. 
  - Such inversion, however, isn't the right choice in every case; moving more complexity higher in the tree makes those higher-level components more complicated and forces the lower-level components to be more flexible than you may want.
  - You’re not limited to a single child for a component. You may pass multiple children, or even have multiple separate “slots” for children
- example

```JavaScript
function Page(props) {
  const user = props.user;
  const content = <Feed user={user} />;
  const topBar = (
    <NavigationBar>
      <Link href={user.permalink}>
        <Avatar user={user} size={props.avatarSize} />
      </Link>
    </NavigationBar>
  );
  return (
    <PageLayout
      topBar={topBar}
      content={content}
    />
  );
}
```

  - This pattern is sufficient for many cases when you need to decouple a child from its immediate parents. 
  - You can take it even further with render props if the child needs to communicate with the parent before rendering.
  - sometimes the same data needs to be accessible by many components in the tree, and at different nesting levels. 
  - Context lets you “broadcast” such data, and changes to it, to all components below. 
  - Common examples where using context might be simpler than the alternatives include managing the current locale, theme, or a data cache.

## Exercise of the Day

[x] **Challenge:** Security Awareness Training

- Objectives:
   1. At the end of the session, I should be able to understand basics of ISMS and what does ISMS comprises of.

1. What is Information Security?
   - The practice of ensuring the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of Information.
2. How does Security gets Compromised?
   1. Affects individuals and organisations
   2. can be caused by external/internal sources
3. CIA Triad
   1. Confidentiality: Only authorized users and processes should be ablt to accessor modify data
   2. Integrity: Data should be maintained in a correct state and nobody should be able to improperly modify it
   3. Availability: Authorized users should be able to access data whenever they need to do so
4. What is Information Security Management System (ISMS)?
   1. A documented management system with a set of security controls to protect
5. An effective ISMS should contain:
   1. A management approved, high level information security policy
   2. An inventory of important information assets (data & systems) that fall within the scope
   3. An assessment of risks to those assets
   4. A corporate risk treatment plan
   5. An ISMS manual that contains a Statement of Applicability
   6. A comprehensive, inter-related suite of processes, polices, procedures, & work instructions.
6. Why is an ISMS important?
   1. increase attack resilience
   2. respond to evolving security threats
   3. protects the CIA of Information
   4. provides Organization -- Wide Protection
   5. Legal & Regulatory COmpliance Requirement
7. How to create an ISMS?
   1. Plan
   2. Do
   3. Check
   4. Act
8. What is ISO27001/ISO27002?
   1. a document established by consensus and approved by a recognized body, that provides for common and repeated use rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context
9. Documentation Structure
   1.  Policy Management
   2.  Procedures (Executives)
   3.  Work Instructions (Operational)
   4.  Records (all users and usages)

## What difficulties did I encounter and How do I solve the issues?
<!-- This is where I write down the problem and write down the steps for solving the issues I had encountered-->
<!-- example 1. While setting up ios & android simulator and emulator, face a minor connectivity issue with my android phone. error message "Could not load expo Network response timed out"
  After asking Mr Google, I found a few solutions:
   - installed Android Studio
   - turnoff my firewall
   - setup Android Studio Emulator
![Error Msg](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/Screenshot1.png "style=width:200 height: 200") -->
**Project difficulties:** <br/>

1. A very unproductive day, due to a relapse of left shoulder tendon inflammation, only managed to finish the 'useReducers' tutorial, finished Security Awareness Training and HTX SHARE project onboarding admin work but very low in energy today didn't managed to do much coding exercises.

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Put too much time on reading and researching on new concepts, practice to shorten the duration by time-boxing to 60 minutes.

- Continue to work on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it.

- Day 23 is to learn and practice on Day 14 & 15 learning materials on React Native concepts

- required a lot improvement on refactoring codes with fingertips familiarity

- research on Redux and its features and how to apply it

- recover from shoulder injury, catch up on Day 14 task

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Miscellaneous
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

## Monthly Experiment
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

## MY GOAL for learning React Native

### Aim to practice by building many small projects with TypeScript then React Native to embed the concepts deeply

#### Possible Project Work

**I wished to:** <br/>

1. Create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket

6. A wellness app that provides more scientifically proven and generally understood advices to a health diet
7. An app to provide a more balanced healthcare for the various developed nations
8. An wellness and diet advisor app based on blood test result.
9. A bookstore app that provides a unified platform for all kinds of books and magazines.
10. A multilingual recipe app that provides recipes and nutrition facts to promote eat well eat healthy Southeast-Asia Cuisine.
