# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in your life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude-->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of of Dharma: **"Seek my higher Self"**<br/>
Discover my unique talents <br/>
Ask myself how I can best suited to serve humanity. <br/>
Using my unique talents and serving others brings unlimited bliss and abundance. <br/>

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Do Not Commit to Anyone <br/>
Play the Virgin Queen: give them hope but never satisfaction.

**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"To be wronged is nothing unless you continue to remember it" - Confucius

**I'm grateful that:** the Universe is working for my greater good.

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
1. To be 1% better than yesterday
2. To enact Day 6 to Day 9 concepts practice and recreate a new demo RN App
3. To create and display a responsive table component on Demo Application
4. To understand how GridView works with FlatList
5. Complete 2hr of Understanding TypeScript contents

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to your Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->
1. House Cleaning

## Personal Notes

**Day 13 (Saturday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Doing React Native & TypeScript concepts, keep practice and do some online tutorial questions to further familiarize with React Native + TypeScript fundamentals.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about your personal growth and should be an essential part of your work journal. -->
- practice on how to create React component
- practice on adding table component, gridView, and another new list component and add some button at home page and navigate to the various page by clicking the button
- have a deeper understanding the relationship between component in order to navigate between different components

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Put too much time on reading and researching on new concepts, practice to shorten the duration by time-boxing to 60 minutes.

- Continue to work on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it.

- Day 14 is continue to learn and practice on Day 9 notes of React Native concepts and spend some time work on TypeScript & React course.

## Miscellaneous
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

## Monthly Experiment
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

## MY GOAL

### Aim to practice by building many small projects with TypeScript then React Native to embed the concepts deeply

#### Possible Project Work

**I wished to:** <br/>

1. Create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket
