# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in your life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude-->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of of Dharma: **"Seek my higher Self"**<br/>
Discover my unique talents <br/>
Ask myself how I can best suited to serve humanity. <br/>
Using my unique talents and serving others brings unlimited bliss and abundance. <br/>

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Do Not Commit to Anyone <br/>
Play the Virgin Queen: give them hope but never satisfaction.

**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"To be wronged is nothing unless you continue to remember it" - Confucius

**I'm grateful that:** the Universe is working for my greater good.

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
1. To be 1% better than yesterday
2. To enact Day 6 to Day 9 concepts practice and recreate a new demo RN App
3. To create and display a responsive table component on Demo Application
4. To understand how GridView works with FlatList
5. Complete 2hr of Understanding TypeScript contents

## Unplanned Work
<!-- This is where you write down work that comes up. For example, need me to run a quick errand or my co-worker needs help. My goal should be to finish and record these activities as fast as possible so I can go back to your Outcome-Based Goals ==> the work you planned to get done. -->
1. House Cleaning
2. Fruits Shopping

## Personal Notes

**Day 12 (Friday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Doing React Native & TypeScript concepts, keep practice and do some online tutorial questions to further familiarize with React Native + TypeScript fundamentals.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about your personal growth and should be an essential part of your work journal. -->
  - understand how to write buttons and touchableOpacity element adding onPress props
  - understand how to make use of navigation properties and navigate to different pages by clicking on a RN default buttons
  - understand about how to refactor the components so the code look leaner and cleaner
  - How To Create Custom Components in React
  - try building out 3 reusable React Components: Layout component, Event Listener, and Query/Mutation (specific to GraphQL)
  - repetitive creation of wrappers with the same CSS style
  - repetitive use of event listeners
  - repetitive use of the same GraphQL script
  - understand how to create reusable React Component from scratch
  - practice on Layout Props
  - practice on Props aka properties
  - understand how to set margin in react native
  - try building RN text style props
  - try 5 shortcuts that will instantly boost my coding productivity
  - try create react component boilerplate shortcut
  - understand how to use "rnfes" emmet shortcuts for class component skeleton with export & style functions
  - read about ECMA-262 => Standard defines the ECMAScript 2021 general-purpose programming language.
  - try to understand what is ECMAScript
  - understand more on what is Mapped Types, destructuring assignment, Spread syntax(...) and rest parameters
  - read about Variadic function
  - practice more on JS ternary operator, 
  - understand for best practice: don't use nested ternaries statements => use if statements may requires more lines of code, but readability is always more important
  - understand for best practice: don't do Assignments inside tenaries statement => it's better to write the code so that the assignment happens after the ternary is resolved
  - practice more on Arrow Functions
  - revision on constructor method, Classes, class expression, class declaration, and class inheritance, , and super

1. **Principles: Reusable, configuring custom component, image download,**

- Reusable Custom Component
  - write something
<br/>

- Configurations Custom component
  - write something
<br/>

- Destructuring assignment
  - The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables
<br/>

- Mapped Types
  - Mapped types build on the syntax for index signatures, which are used to declare the types of properties which have not been declared ahead of time
<br/>

- Rest parameters
  - The rest parameter syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array, providing a way to represent variadic functions in JavaScript
<br/>

- Variadic functions
  - In mathematics and in computer programming, a variadic function is a function of indefinite arity, i.e., one which accepts a variable number of arguments. Support for variadic functions differs widely among programming languages.
<br/>

- Spread syntax (...)
  - allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.
<br/>

- Arrow function expressions
  - An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, but is limited and can't be used in all situations.

  - The differences between arrow functions and traditional functions, as well as some limitations:
    => Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to 'this' or 'super', and should not be used as methods.
    => Arrow functions don't have access to the new.target keyword.
    => Arrow functions aren't suitable for call, apply and bind methods, which generally rely on establishing a scope.
    => Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors.
    => Arrow functions cannot use yield, within its body.
<br/>

- constructor
  - The constructor method is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object instance of that class.
  - A constructor enables you to provide any custom initialization that must be done before any other methods can be called on an instantiated object.
<br/>

- Classes
  - Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data

- class expression
  - The class expression is one way to define a class. Similar to function expressions, class expressions can be named or unnamed. If named, the name of the class is local to the class body only.
  - JavaScript classes use prototype-based inheritance.

```JavaScript
const MyClass = class [className] [extends otherClassName] {
  // class body
}
```

  - A class expression has a similar syntax to a class declaration (statement). As with class statements, the body of a class expression is executed in strict mode.
  - There are several differences between class expressions and class statements, however:
    => Class expressions may omit the class name ("binding identifier"), which is not possible with class statements.
    => Class expressions allow you to redefine (re-declare) classes without throwing a SyntaxError. This is not the case with class statements.
<br/>

- extends
  - The extends keyword can be used to subclass custom classes as well as built-in objects.
  - The .prototype of the extension must be an Object or null.

```JavaScript
class ChildClass extends ParentClass { /* ... */ }
```
- super
  - The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.
  - When used in a constructor, the super keyword appears alone and must be used before the this keyword is used. The super keyword can also be used to call functions on a parent object.

```JavaSCript
super([arguments]); // calls the parent constructor.
super.functionOnParent([arguments]);
```

## Exercise of the Day

[x] **Challenge:** challenge header

1. Challenge Questions:
   1. write something
![solution image1](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/solutionimage.png "style=width:200 height: 200")

## What difficulties did I encounter and How do I solve the issues?
<!-- This is where I write down the problem and write down the steps for solving the issues I had encountered-->
<!-- example 1. While setting up ios & android simulator and emulator, face a minor connectivity issue with my android phone. error message "Could not load expo Network response timed out"
  After asking Mr Google, I found a few solutions:
   - installed Android Studio
   - turnoff my firewall
   - setup Android Studio Emulator
![Error Msg](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/Screenshot1.png "style=width:200 height: 200") -->
**Project difficulties:** <br/>

  ```javascript
  git push origin --delete showsolution/codes
  ```

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Put too much time on reading and researching on new concepts, practice to shorten the duration by time-boxing to 60 minutes.

- Continue to work on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it.

- Day 12 is continue to learn and practice on Day 8 & 9 notes of React Native concepts and at the same time work on TypeScript projects.

- more reflection here

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Miscellaneous
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

## Monthly Experiment
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

## MY GOAL

### Aim to practice by building many small projects with TypeScript then React Native to embed the concepts deeply

#### Possible Project Work

**I wished to:** <br/>

1. Create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket
5. A food & nutrition app that provide food portions in smaller sizes to stimulate reduction of food consumption and reduction of food waste
6. A wellness app that provides more scientifically proven and generally understood advices to a health diet
7. An app to provide a more balanced healthcare for the various developed nations
8. An wellness and diet advisor app based on blood test result.
9. A bookstore app that provides a unified platform for all kinds of books and magazines.
