# What I Learned today?

Today marked the first day of apprenticeship and I am very happy to be able to start my journey into the world of programming. I have been looking forward to learn a lot of new things from everyone and hopefully able to share my knowledge with others.<br>
<br>
Day 1 was mainly  assigned to familiarize company's environment, vision, value  and personnels.<br>
After daily standup with Anya & Russel in mid-morning, we continued to setup company-issued machines with  related software preparing for next 40 days of  React Native lessons before we started our on-the-job training.<br>


## What difficulties did I encounter?

As part of setting up, we are required to clone and push a new repo to github. Being unfamiliar with a new machine, I had face a login issues. I was able to login to my github account, I was able to clone the repo but was unable to push the changes to the repo.

## How do I solve the issues?

After some reading on Goggle search, identify it as a security issue and then follow the steps to fix it.
I delete my github token and then re-setup a new SSH key with the help of Github instructions.
After fixing the issue, I was able to push the changes to the repo.

## Room to improve?
I need to more familiarize with git and github.
To be more productive in problem-solving, I need to learn more about the different ways to solve a problem.
