# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude-->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Least Effort: **"Is that so?" Apply the Power of Non-Resistance**<br/>
Shows the good through inner non-resistance. <br/>
Accept people, situations and events as they occur. Take responsibility for my situation and for all events seen as problems. <br/>
Relinquish the need to defend my point of view. <br/>

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Despise the Free Lunch <br/>
What has worth is worth paying for. It is often wise to pay the full price -- there is no cutting corners with excellence. <br/>
Learn to pay and to pay well. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"I value self-discipline, but creating systems that make it next to impossible to misbehave is more reliable than self-control." - Tim Ferriss

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm grateful for:** my comfortable bed, helping me to recover my tired body and fatigue mind, as I wake up refreshed today to a brand new beautiful day.

<!-- what is holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Subconscious Behaviour that are Keeping Me from Having The Life I Want:
<br/>
I think "problems" are roadblocks to achieving what I want, when in reality they are pathways. <br/>
<br/>
Marcus Aurelius sums this up well: "The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way." <br/>
Simply, running into a "problem" forces me to take action to resolve it. That action will inevitably lead me to think differently, behave differently, and choose differently. <br/> The "problem" becomes a catalyst for me to actualize the life I always wanted. It pushed me from my comfort zone, that's all <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When or Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Reflection of the day?**

- [x] To protect myself against temptations is to avoid them, plain old preparation is more valuable than self-control. <br/>
- [x] Prepare myself for difficult situation by putting up roadblocks ahead of time, when my resolve isn't being test. <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying
 -->
 <!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
 After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!--Learn Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
  1. something only I can do;
  2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!--Learn What is Low Leverage Activities:
  1. Anyone can do it
  2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->
<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 24 (Wednesday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today will be working on revision on useState, useReducer, try refactor with reducers and change to TSX and refine the code as much as possible. In the afternoon, will try to catch up and practice on Day 16 Vid 63 to 69 task.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
1. Community Convention
- Our Action Object Had..

```JavaScript
{colorToChange: 'red', amount: 15}
```

usually by convention, we'll instead use:

```JavaScript
{type: 'change_red', payload: 15}
```

- type --> String that describes the exact change operation we want to make
- payload --> some data that critical to the change operation

**Principles: useReducer vs useState**

- **When to use useState or useReducer?**
  1. useState hook is used to update state in functional components by setting the initial state and returning the actual state and an updater function:

example

```JavaScript
<mark>import React, { useState } from 'react';</mark>

const Counter = () => {
  <mark>const [count, setCount] = useState(0);</mark>

  const handleIncrease = () => {
    <mark>setCount(count => count + 1);</mark>
  };

  const handleDecrease = () => {
    <mark>setCount(count => count - 1);</mark>
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter with useState</h1>
      <mark><p>Count: {count}</p></mark>

      <div>
        <button type="button" onClick={handleIncrease}>
          +
        </button>
        <button type="button" onClick={handleDecrease}>
          -
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

- useReducer hook also can be used to update state, but it does so in a more sophisticated way: 

  - it accepts a reducer function and an initial state, and it returns the actual state and a dispatch function. 
  - The dispatch function alters state in an implicit way by mapping actions to state transitions:

example

```JavaScript
<mark>import React, { useReducer } from 'react';</mark>

<mark>const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREASE':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREASE':
      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
};</mark>

const Counter = () => {
  <mark>const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });</mark>

  const handleIncrease = () => {
    <mark>dispatch({ type: 'INCREASE' });</mark>
  };

  const handleDecrease = () => {
    <mark>dispatch({ type: 'DECREASE' });</mark>
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter with useReducer</h1>
      <mark><p>Count: {state.count}</p></mark>

      <div>
        <button type="button" onClick={handleIncrease}>
          +
        </button>
        <button type="button" onClick={handleDecrease}>
          -
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

- Both example above uses a different hook for state management; but solve the same business case, but in different ways. 

- Questions: When would I use one state-management solution or the other?

  **SIMPLE VS. COMPLEX STATE WITH HOOKS**
  - The reducer example below encapsulated the count property into a state object, but we could have done this more simply by using count as the actual state.
  - Refactoring to eliminate the state object and code count as a JavaScript integer primitive, we see that this use case doesn't involve managing a complex state:

example

```JavaScript
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREASE':
      <mark>return state + 1;</mark>
    case 'DECREASE':
      <mark>return state - 1;</mark>
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
};

const Counter = () => {
  <mark>const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, 0);</mark>

  const handleIncrease = () => {
    dispatch({ type: 'INCREASE' });
  };

  const handleDecrease = () => {
    dispatch({ type: 'DECREASE' });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter with useReducer</h1>
     <mark> <p>Count: {count}</p> </mark>

      <div>
        <button type="button" onClick={handleIncrease}>
          +
        </button>
        <button type="button" onClick={handleDecrease}>
          -
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

- In this case, because there is no complex state object, we may be better off using a simple useState hook. 
- We can refactor our state object to a primitive.
- **once move past managing a primitive (i.e. a string, integer, or boolean) and instead must manage a complex object (e.g. with arrays and additional primitives), It may be better of using useReducer.**
  - A good rule of thumb is:
    1. Use useState whenever you manage a JS primitive
    2. Use useReducer whenever you manage an object or array
- The rule of thumb suggests that, once I spot const [state, setState] = useState({ firstname: 'Robin', lastname: 'Wieruch' }) in my code, I may be better off with useReducer instead of useState.
<br/>

  **SIMPLE VS. COMPLEX STATE TRANSITIONS WITH HOOKS**
  - If we hadn't used two different action types (INCREASE and DECREASE) in our previous state transitions, what could we have done differently? 
    - By using the optional payload that comes with every dispatched action object, we could specify how much we want to increase or decrease count from the outside of the reducer. 
    - This moves the state transition towards being more implicit:

example

```JavaScript
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    <mark>case 'INCREASE_OR_DECREASE_BY':
      return state + action.by;</mark>
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
};

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, 0);

  const handleIncrease = () => {
   <mark> dispatch({ type: 'INCREASE_OR_DECREASE_BY', by: 1 });</mark>
  };

  const handleDecrease = () => {
   <mark> dispatch({ type: 'INCREASE_OR_DECREASE_BY', by: -1 }); </mark>
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter with useReducer</h1>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>

      <div>
        <button type="button" onClick={handleIncrease}>
          +
        </button>
        <button type="button" onClick={handleDecrease}>
          -
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

## Exercise of the Day

[x] **Challenge:** Try to add reducer logic to our CounterScreen

1. Challenge Questions:
   1. Change to TypeScript + refactor as much as possible

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## What difficulties did I encounter and How do I solve the issues?
<!-- This is where I write down the problem and write down the steps for solving the issues I had encountered-->
<!-- example 1. While setting up ios & android simulator and emulator, face a minor connectivity issue with my android phone. error message "Could not load expo Network response timed out"
  After asking Mr Google, I found a few solutions:
   - installed Android Studio
   - turnoff my firewall
   - setup Android Studio Emulator
![Error Msg](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/Screenshot1.png "style=width:200 height: 200") -->

  ```

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Had make good progress on practice to time-boxing my task to 90 minutes per self-assigned task.

- Continue to revise on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it.

- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.

- Day 25 is to redo on Day 15 & 16 & 17 tasks learn and practice on Day 18 notes of React Native concepts and at the same time work on TypeScript conversion, behind schedule by 2.0 days.

- Practice extra practice to better understanding of the useState & useReducer.

- Need to further improve on technical writing of learning experience and daily task reviews with what I had learn, issues encountered, display of code, display challenge results, error message etc....

- Add one more column for technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- To learn and use .gif to display completed challenge display and .png for error and warning messages display.

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

## MY GOAL for learning React Native

### Aim to practice by building many small projects with TypeScript then React Native to embed the concepts deeply

#### Possible Project Work

**I wished to:** <br/>

1. Create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket
5. A food & nutrition app that provide food portions in smaller sizes to stimulate reduction of food consumption and reduction of food waste
6. A wellness app that provides more scientifically proven and generally understood advices to a health diet
7. An app to provide a more balanced healthcare for the various developed nations
8. An wellness and diet advisor app based on blood test result.
9. A bookstore app that provides a unified platform for all kinds of books and magazines.
10. A multilingual recipe app that provides recipes and nutrition facts to promote eat well eat healthy Southeast-Asia Cuisine.
