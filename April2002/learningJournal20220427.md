# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude-->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Pure Potentiality: **"Maybe?" => Illustrate the wisdom of non-judgement**<br/>
Take time to be silent, to just BE. <br/> Meditate for 30 minutes twice a day. <br/>
Silently witness the intelligence within every living thing. Practice non-judgement. <br/>

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Avoid the False Alliance <br/>
Cultivate real allies. Find those with mutual self-interests and make an alliance. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Life's easy when you live it the hard way... and hard if you try to live it the easy way" - Dave Kekich

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm grateful that:** to know the trick is to be grateful when my mood is high and graceful when it is low.

<!-- what is holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Subconscious Behaviour that are Keeping Me from Having The Life I Want:
<br/>
I assume that when it comes to following my "gut instincts", happiness is "GOOD" and fear and pain are "BAD". <br/>
When I consider doing something that I truly love and are invested in, I am going to feel influx of pain and fear, mostly because it will involve being vulnerable. <br/>
Bad feelings should not always be interpreted as deterrents. They are also indicators that I am doing something frightening and worthwhile. <br/>
Not wanting to do something would make me feel indifferent about it. <br/>
(FEAR === INTEREST) <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
<!-- Critical Thinking Training:
- ask the "5 WHYs?" 
  1. Why the problem is occurring?
  2. Why on answer of Qns 1
  3. Why on answer of Qns 2
  4. Why on answer of Qns 3
  5. Why on answer of Qns 4
     - Find the root cause
- Who does this benefit?
- What's the context?
- When or Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem? -->
**Questions of the day?**

- [] How likely is this person to achieve anything substantial in life if their primary value is to feel comfortable? <br/>
- [] How is this person going to manage a crisis that they must face? <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying
 -->
 <!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
 After I finished [CONDITION], I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!-- Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
  1. something only I can do;
  2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!-- What is Low Leverage Activities:
  1. Anyone can do it
  2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->
<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 17 (Wednesday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today will be working on plans and goals for the next couple of months. Summarizing what I had learned from books and put it to black & white and try to tap on high leverage activities to overcome my slow learning progress and direct easy distracted mindset to improve my focus in near future.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
- how i can apply the below-mentioned principle to my coding and programming skills

**Principles:**

- The Four Laws of Behavior Change: make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying
<br/>

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Exercise of the Day

[x] **Challenge:** Rewrite the way I write my daily goals to make it productive and easy to read

1. Challenge Questions:
   1. write something
![solution image1](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/solutionimage.png "style=width:200 height: 200")

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## What difficulties did I encounter and How do I solve the issues?
<!-- This is where I write down the problem and write down the steps for solving the issues I had encountered-->
<!-- example 1. While setting up ios & android simulator and emulator, face a minor connectivity issue with my android phone. error message "Could not load expo Network response timed out"
  After asking Mr Google, I found a few solutions:
   - installed Android Studio
   - turnoff my firewall
   - setup Android Studio Emulator
![Error Msg](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/Screenshot1.png "style=width:200 height: 200") -->
**Project difficulties:** <br/>

1. define problem here
   ![problemScreenshots](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/problemScreenshots.png "style=width:200 height: 200")

- solution steps here
   ![solutionSteps](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/solutionSteps.png "style=width:200 height: 200")
<!-- can include some codes for future use -->
```typescript
   style = { [styles.first, styles.second ] }
```

## What other issues trying to resolve? <br/>

1. define problem here
![ErrorImagehere](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/errorimage.png "style=width:200 height: 200")
  After some research, I found some solutions:
   - define solution here

  ```javascript
  git push origin --delete showsolution/codes
  ```

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Put too much time on reading and researching on new concepts, practice to shorten the duration by time-boxing to 60 minutes.

- Continue to work on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it.

- Day 15 is continue to learn and practice on Day 8 & 9 notes of React Native concepts and at the same time work on TypeScript projects.

- more reflection here

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

## MY GOAL for learning React Native

### Aim to practice by building many small projects with TypeScript then React Native to embed the concepts deeply

#### Possible Project Work

**I wished to:** <br/>

1. Create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket
5. A food & nutrition app that provide food portions in smaller sizes to stimulate reduction of food consumption and reduction of food waste
6. A wellness app that provides more scientifically proven and generally understood advices to a health diet
7. An app to provide a more balanced healthcare for the various developed nations
8. An wellness and diet advisor app based on blood test result.
9. A bookstore app that provides a unified platform for all kinds of books and magazines.
10. A multilingual recipe app that provides recipes and nutrition facts to promote eat well eat healthy Southeast-Asia Cuisine.
11. Build a Chatbot that can provide a personalized service to the user based on the user's input
