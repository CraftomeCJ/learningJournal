# Quotes & Gratitude of the Day?
<!-- write this part early in the morning (before the hustle bustle of work) so that I can keep my focus on the big picture. 
It allows me to appreciate the small things in my life. 
Daily Law, Law of the day, Quotes & Gratitude-->
**Law of Life:** <br/>
The Law of Karma: **What goes around, comes around**<br/>
Every action generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind. <br/>
Choosing actions that bring happiness and success to others ensures the flow of happiness and success to me.<br/>

**Daily Law:** <br/>
Make my Accomplishments Seem Effortless <br/>
My actions must seem natural and executed with ease. <br/>
When I act, act as if I could do much more. <br/>
Avoid the temptation of revealing how hard I work -- it only raises questions. <br/>

<!-- What a wise old man said -->
**Quote of the Day:** <br/>
"Willpower is what separates us from the animals. <br/>
It's the capacity to restrain our impulses, resist temptation -- do what's right and good for us in the long run, not what we want to do right now. <br/>
It's central, in fact, to civilization." - Roy Baumeister

<!-- practice gratitude daily -->
**I'm grateful for:** what I am and have. My thanksgiving is perpetual.

<!-- what is holding me back all these years -->
**How to Approach my Life like the Greats:** <br/>
Subconscious Behaviour that are Keeping Me from Having The Life I Want:
<br/>
I think that to change my beliefs, I have to adopt a new line of thinking, <br/>
rather than seeking experiences that make the thinking self-evident. <br/>
A belief is what I know to be true because experience has make it evident to me. <br/>
If I want to change my life, change my beliefs. <br/>
If I want to change my beliefs, go out and have experiences that make them real to me. <br/>
Not the opposite way around. <br/>

<!-- for daily reflections -->
**Reflection of the day?**

- [x] Craving in to temptation whenever I feel them emerge is like giving up humanity. As a intelligent human being, I have the ability to make decisions based on rational thinking, not on instincts alone. <br/>
- [x] Strive to be a better human and embrace humanity by exercise my "WILLPOWER MUSCLE". <br/>

# Outcome-Based Goals
<!-- This is where I write out my goals/to-do at work. These should be planned and written at the start of the day so I can make progress towards them by the end of the day. -->
<!-- 
S => Precise and specific no room for misinterpreting
M => easy to track
A => must be achievable in 24hour
R => contribute to ultimate goal
T => define start and end date
How to set GOAL LOOP:
(make it obvious)
1. Cue: I hit a stumbling block on learning programming at work.
(make it attractive)
2. Craving: I feel stuck and want to relieve my stress.
(make it easy)
3. Response: I pulled out my iPad and read a technical book.
(make it satisfying)
4. Reward: I satisfy my craving to feel relieved. ==> reading book becomes associated with feeling stalled at studying
 -->
 <!-- Apply this strategy when setting GOALs 
 I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].-->
## **Long Term Goals:**
<!-- Improvement with High Leverage Activities:
  1. something only I can do;
  2. Results are worth a multiple of the energy put into it (ROI) -->
<!-- What is Low Leverage Activities:
  1. Anyone can do it
  2. Energy in is less than or equal to the results -->
<!-- Learn to combine Low Leverage Activities into High Leverage activities with unavoidable low leverage activities in your life. -->

## Personal Notes

**Day 23 (Tuesday) and today's main focus:** <br />
Today will be working on Day 14 & 15 tasks: how to manage state with reducers. Practice on courses exercises, try to implement useReducer for counterScreen.
At the same time change to TypeScript & refactor as much as possible.

## What I had learned today?
<!-- Throughout the day things may pop-up in my head that I may want to personally get done. This section is focused about my personal growth and should be an essential part of my work journal. -->
- The useReducer() hook in React lets you separate the state management from the rendering logic of the component.
- useReducer also allows you to manage state and re-render a component whenever that state changes.
- Reducer give you more concrete way to handle complex states so it give you set actions that you can perform on your state and it's going to convert your current to a new version fo the state based on the action that you send.
- Reducer going to return an array with two portions
  1. This first potion is state
  2. Second things is return a function

**Principles: useReducer**

- Continue to do read up and understand the concept of Reducer
- Convert counterScreen from useState to useReducer
<br/>

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Exercise of the Day

[x] **Challenge:** Change to typescript + code refactor

1. Challenge Questions:
   1. Change the code from js to typescript and try to refactor
   2. Replace switch-case by ternary operator due to only two type of action

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## What difficulties did I encounter and How do I solve the issues?
<!-- This is where I write down the problem and write down the steps for solving the issues I had encountered-->
<!-- example 1. While setting up ios & android simulator and emulator, face a minor connectivity issue with my android phone. error message "Could not load expo Network response timed out"
  After asking Mr Google, I found a few solutions:
   - installed Android Studio
   - turnoff my firewall
   - setup Android Studio Emulator
![Error Msg](https://github.com/CraftomeCJ/learningJournal/blob/main/image/Screenshot1.png "style=width:200 height: 200") -->
**Project difficulties:** <br/>

1. useReducer a bit complex compared to useState, may need more time to understand useState before doing Reducer to avoid confusing myself further

<p align="center">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Room to improve?
<!-- This is where I write things I can do to improve my work -->
<!-- Reflecting and Reviewing My Daily Work Journal
note To make the most of work journal, ensure to carve out time for review and reflection. 
Doing this at least once/twice a month, however, I may do it more often if career growth is a high priority. 

ask During this time ask yourself:
=> Are my skills growing in the work that I am doing?
=>How am I getting better or plan to get better over the next month?
=>What were some areas of improvements for better productivity at work?
=>Did I spend time on important tasks that will help accelerate my career?

These questions will help me review and unlock areas of improvement (which will be never-ending) in my life, career and work. This step can feel uncomfortable and requires self-awareness and review. -->
- Had make good progress on practice to time-boxing my task to 90 minutes per self-assigned task.

- Continue to work on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it.

- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.

- Day 24 is continue to learn and practice on Day 14 & 15 & 16 notes of React Native concepts and at the same time work on TypeScript conversion, behind schedule by 1.5 days.

- Practice more to have better understanding of the useState & useReducer.

- Layout of working journal look good, from day 24 onwards will improve on technical writing of learning experience and daily lesson task reviews.

- Add one more column for technical book's chapter summary for future reference.

- To learn and use gif to showcase course project display and png for error and warning messages display.

<!-- ## Miscellaneous -->
<!-- Sometimes the goal or task at hand has many sub-tasks and that is when I use here to write it out and track my progress towards it. -->

<!-- ## Monthly Experiment -->
<!-- This is the section where I remind myself what personal growth experiment/ side hustle experiment I am focused on for this day, week, or month. For example, in the above journal entry, I was (and still am) focused on "essential-ism focus" ==> a fancy way to say to focus on one thing and one thing only. -->

## MY GOAL for learning React Native

### Aim to practice by building many small projects with TypeScript then React Native to embed the concepts deeply

#### Possible Project Work

**I wished to:** <br/>

1. Create a marketplace app either host a numbers of ecommerce sites or dedicate app for my wife's Amigurumi doll's e-store
2. A predictive investment signal app based on Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Machine Learning that break the Law of irrationalities.
3. A driverless car booking app
4. A food science app that offer unified insights into the ingredients of food in any supermarket
5. A food & nutrition app that provide food portions in smaller sizes to stimulate reduction of food consumption and reduction of food waste
6. A wellness app that provides more scientifically proven and generally understood advices to a health diet
7. An app to provide a more balanced healthcare for the various developed nations
8. An wellness and diet advisor app based on blood test result.
9. A bookstore app that provides a unified platform for all kinds of books and magazines.
10. A multilingual recipe app that provides recipes and nutrition facts to promote eat well eat healthy Southeast-Asia Cuisine.
11. Build a Chatbot that can provide a personalized service to the user based on the user's input
