# What I Learned today?

- Day 6  of apprenticeship and today's focus mainly on Arrow Functions and Classes & Interfaces:

- Dig deep on Arrow function and practice on 5 quiz
- Learn more on ways to refactor if/else statements
- Practice on how to apply forEach, for/in, for/of to write cleaner code
- Learn more on Classes and Interfaces
- Try to define a class and create a new instance
- Learn more deeply on unknown type
- Practice on create method class
- Practice on implementing interfaces
- Practice on extending class
- Learn more on Member Visibility
- How to apply static property and methods
- Learn more on Generic Classes and this. syntax
- Completed Udemy's course content on Classes and Interfaces

## What difficulties did I encounter?

1. Got confuse on using : unknown type as a return type

```typeScript
let sumFunctionWithIf = (a:number, b:number, inconsistentParameter: any): unknown => {
  if (inconsistentParameter === undefined){
    return a+b
  } else {
   return a+b+inconsistentParameter
  }
}
console.log(sumFunctionThatMayBreak(10,39,2)); // => 51
console.log(sumFunctionThatMayBreak(12,40, undefined));// => 52 but result still NaN
```

###### possible solution

```typeScript
let sumFunctionWithIf = (
    a: number,
    b: number,
    inconsistentParameter: unknown,
  ): number => {
    console.log(inconsistentParameter);
    if (typeof inconsistentParameter === "number") {
      return a + b + inconsistentParameter;
    } else {
      return a + b;
    }
  };

  console.log(sumFunctionWithIf(1, 2, undefined));
```

## How do I solve the issues?

After explanation from Anya & Janna my puzzle is half solved may required more practice to learn more.

1. Understand more on : unknown type
   - Understand need to verify if its type is number before I can do + operator
   - Understand if not sure what is inconsistentParameter is, I can use unknown type
   - Understand before I can do some operator with parameter, I need to check the type
   - Understand if I define inconsistentParameter as a number, I need be sure to pass in a number instead of undefined unless I make it as optional and the return type has to be number as I see, and return a number, no need to cast it to be unknown to confuse myself
   - Understand the purpose of the TypeScript is to make things very clear instead of confusion
   - Understand the ": types" of the parameters can be mixed, they are independent, it's depended on what the function will do with the parameters
   - below an example of unknown parameter, to help me understand what is the usage of the unknown type
  
 ```typeScript
export const someErrorLogFunc = (error: unknown): void => {
    if (error instanceof SomeExitingError) {
        return;
    }
    const exception = error instanceof Error ? error : new Error(error + "");
    doSomethingWith(exception)
}; 
```

##### Reason

we don't know what the error type will be, it might be a string, an object or something we never know, so we need to use unknown type

## Room to improve?

- Try to finished up with Day 4 & 5 notes, currently lagging behind by 1.5 days work.

- Still pushing hard to understand OOP concepts: Classes, Instances, Constructors and this. syntax

- Continue to work on the more advance concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it.

- Day 7 is continue to learn and practice Class & Interfaces, Object Types, Decorators and Modules

- After completed Oject Types and Modules, will move on to build Udemy's Drag & Drop Project on Sunday Evening.

## MY GOAL

#### Aim to practice by building many small projects with TypeScript then React Native to embed the concepts deeply
